<h2>Preface</h2>


<p>This book describes the life of the Feudal Ages in
terms of the concrete. The discussions center around a
certain seigneury of St. Aliquis. If no such barony is
easily identifiable, at least there were several hundred
second-grade fiefs scattered over western Christendom
which were in essential particulars extremely like it,
and its Baron Conon and his associates were typical of
many similar individuals, a little worse or a little better,
who abounded in the days of Philip Augustus.</p>

<p>No custom is described which does not seem fairly
characteristic of the general period. To focus the picture
a specific region, northern France, and a specific year,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1220, have been selected. Not many matters
have been mentioned, however, which were not more or
less common to contemporaneous England and Germany;
nor have many usages been explained which
would not frequently have been found as early as <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1100 or as late as 1300.</p>

<p>Northern France was <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i> the homeland of
Feudalism and hardly less so of Chivalry, while by
general consent the years around 1220 mark one of the
great turning epochs of the Middle Ages. We are at the
time of the development of French kingship under
Philip Augustus, of the climax and the beginning of the
waning of the crusading spirit, of the highest development
of Gothic architecture, of the full blossoming of the
popular Romance literature, and of the beginning of the
entirely dissimilar, but even more important, Friar
movement.</p>

<p>To make the life of the Middle Ages live again in its
pageantry and its squalor, its superstition and its
triumph of Christian art and love, is the object of this
study. Many times has the author been reminded of the
<em>intense contrasts</em> between sublime good and extreme
evil everywhere apparent in the Feudal Epoch. With
every effort at impartiality, whether praising or condemning,
it is dangerously easy to write in superlatives.</p>

<p>Although the preparation of this book was not undertaken
without that knowledge and investigation of those
medi√¶val authors, ecclesiastics, and laymen upon which
every significant study of this kind must rest, every
scholar will recognize the author's debt to many modern
specialists. To Th. Wright, Lacroix, Luchaire, Justin
H. Smith, Viollet-le-Duc, and Ch√©ruel the acknowledgments
are very specific. To Leon Gautier they must be
more specific still. It is a great misfortune that his
masterpiece, <cite>Le Chivalrie</cite>, is no longer current in a
good English translation. The words in quotation,
sprinkled through the text, are usually from pertinent
medi√¶val writers, except where they purport to be
direct snatches of conversation.</p>

<p>To my colleague in this university, Prof. August C.
Krey, who has read and criticized the manuscript with
friendly fidelity and professional alertness and acumen,
there are due many hearty thanks.</p>

<h2>Chapter I: The Fief of St. Aliquis: Its History
and Denizens.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_016.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">I</span>n the duchy of Quelqueparte there lay,
in the later days of the great King
Philip Augustus, the barony of St.
Aliquis. Perhaps you may have trouble
in finding any such places upon the maps
of Medi√¶val France. In that case, I
must tell you that they did not lie so far from Burgundy,
Champagne, and Blois that the duke and his vassal, the
baron, could not have many brave feuds with the seigneurs
of those principalities, nor so far from Paris that
peddlers and pilgrims could not come hence or go
thither pretty often, nor the baron of St. Aliquis sometimes
journey to the king's court, to do his loyal devoir
to his high suzerain, or to divert himself with many
lordly pleasures.</p>

<p>About <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1220, when King Philip Augustus was near
his end, there was exceptional peace in northern France,
and conditions around St. Aliquis were entirely normal.
We purpose, therefore (with the help of Our Lady, of
holy St. Aliquis himself, and perhaps also of that very
discreet <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">f√©e</i> Queen Morgue, "the wife of Julius C√¶sar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
and the mother of King Oberon"), to visit the aforesaid
barony as it existed at that time. We shall look around
us unseen by the inhabitants, but able to ask many
questions and to get pertinent answers. Thereby shall
we gather much knowledge, and that, too, not about St.
Aliquis only; for this little world by itself is a cross-section,
as it were, of a great part of France; nay, of
all feudal Europe.</p>

<p>It is fortunate that we are suffered, when we make this
return journey to the Middle Ages, to arrive not long
after the year 1200. A century or two earlier one might
have found conditions decidedly more crude, semi-barbarous,
disgusting; one would have indeed been
tempted to doubt whether from so lawless and uncultivated
a world any progressive civilization could really
develop. On the other hand, had we postponed the
excursion until, say, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1400, we would have found a
society already becoming sophisticated and to no slight
extent modernized. The true medi√¶val flavor would
have been partially lost. But <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1220 represents the
epoch when the spirit of the Middle Ages had reached its
full development. The world was still full of ignorance,
squalor, and violence, yet there were now plenty of
signs of a nobler day. France was still scattered with
feudal castles and tales of baronial ruthlessness abounded,
but the rise of the royal power and the growth of the
chartered communal towns were promising a new
political era. The bulk of the people were still illiterate
peasants, and many of the nobility even felt very awkward
when fumbling over books; but the monasteries
had never been so full of worthy activities and of very
genuine learning. Thousands of scholars were trudging
to the University of Paris; and meantime, even in the
more starving towns were rising Gothic churches and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>cathedrals, combining in their soaring fabrics not
merely the results of supreme architectural genius, but
a wealth of masterpieces of sculpture and of colored glass
which were to draw visitors of later days from the very
ends of the earth.</p>

<p>The crusading fervor had somewhat waned, but
around the castles there were still elderly knights who
had once followed Richard the Lion Hearted or Philip
Augustus upon the great Third Crusade to Palestine,
likewise a good many younger cavaliers who had shared
the military glory and moral disgrace of the Fourth
Crusade, which had ended not with the recovery of
Jerusalem, but the sack and seizure of Christian Constantinople.
At Rome the great and magnanimous
Pope Innocent III had hardly ceased to reign (1216);
while the founders of the remarkable Friar movement&mdash;that
new style of monasticism which was to carry the
message of the Church closer to the people&mdash;St. Francis,
the apostle of love, and St. Dominic, the apostle of
learning, were still alive and active. The world, therefore,
was looking forward. The Middle Ages were close
to apogee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Fief of St. Aliquis</div>

<p class="mt2">We purpose to tell what may be found on the barony of
St. Aliquis, first at the castle itself and in the household
of Messire the Seigneur, then in the villages of peasants
round about; next in the abbey slightly removed; and
lastly in the chartered town and cathedral seat of the
bishop a few miles further off. But first one must ask
about the origin of the principality and how there came
to be any such barony at all, for St. Aliquis would have
been an exceptional seigneury if it had not had considerable
history behind it, and had not represented the
growth of several different elements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>The castle of St. Aliquis lies at the junction of two
rivers. The smaller of these, the Rapide, tumbles down
from some hills, cutting a gorge through the dense
beech forest until it runs under a precipitous slope, then
dashes into the greater, more placid current of the Claire.
The Claire is an affluent, perhaps of the Seine, perhaps
of the Loire. It is navigable for flat barges a good
many miles above its junction with the Rapide, and the
tolls upon this commerce swell the baron's revenue.</p>

<p>At the triangle formed by the converging streams rises
an abrupt rocky plateau practically inaccessible from
the banks of either river and which can be approached
only from the third side, where the land slopes gently
away from the apex of the triangle. Here rise
some jagged crags marking out the place as a natural
fortress. Most castles which dot feudal Europe are thus
located in the most advantageous spot in their respective
regions.</p>

<p>Possibly human habitations have existed upon this
promontory ever since God drove Adam and Eve out
of Eden. If we consult Brother Boniface, the librarian
at the local monastery, the best-read person in the district,
the good old man will tell us that long before the
Romans came, the ancient Druids ("now in hell") had
their pagan altars here, and sacrificed human victims
under a great oak. Some chiseled masonry found on the
spot also indicates an extensive settlement in Roman
days, when Gaul was a province of the C√¶sars. Of
course, all the pious people know that under the persecuting
Emperor Diocletian, the holy Aliquis himself,
a centurion in the Legions, was shot to death with burning
arrows because he preferred Christ to Jupiter, and
that the place of his martyrdom is at the new abbey
church about a league from the castle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Founding of the Castle</div>

<p>Nevertheless, secular history is not precise until after
the time of the mighty Charlemagne. Under his feeble
successor, Charles the Bald, tradition affirms that the
vikings, Scandinavian barbarians, came up the greater
river, ascended the Claire in their long dragon ships;
then on the site of the present castle they established a
stockaded camp, whence they issued to ravage the
country. This was about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 870, but after a year
they departed, leaving desolation behind them. About
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 880 another band of vikings came with similar
foul intent, but they met a different reception. The
saints had raised up a brave protector for the Christian
folk of those lands.</p>

<p>Very uncertain is the ancestry of the redoubtable
warrior Heribert, who about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 875 seized the rocky
triangle at the mouth of the Rapide, and built the first
castle of St. Aliquis. Perhaps he was descended from
one of Charlemagne's famous Frankish "counts." He
did, indeed, only what was then being done everywhere
to check the Scandinavian hordes: he built a castle
and organized the levies of the region, hitherto footmen,
into an effective cavalry force. This castle was anything
save the later majestic fortress. It was merely
a great square tower of rough masonry, perched on the
crag above the streams. Around it was a palisade of
heavy timbers, strengthened on the landward side by a
ditch. Inside this compound were huts for refugees,
storehouses for fodder, and rude stalls for the cattle.
To stop passage up the Claire a heavy chain of iron was
stretched across the river and stone piers were sunk at
shallow places, thus forcing boats to pass close under
the fortress in range of descending missiles. Where
the chain was landed there was built another smaller
stone tower. All the crossing then had to be by skiffs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
although somewhat later an unsteady bridge was thrown
over the stream.</p>

<p>The second expedition of vikings found that these
precautions had ruined their adventure. They lost
many men and a dragon ship when they tried to force
the iron chain. Heribert's new cavalry cut off their
raiding parties. Finally they departed with thinned
numbers and scant spoils. Heribert was hailed as
savior of the region, just as other champions, notably
the great Count Odo at the siege of Paris, won similar
successes elsewhere on a larger scale. The vikings had
departed, but Heribert's tower remained. So began
the castle of St. Aliquis.</p>

<p>Heribert had taken possession ostensibly as the king's
"man," claiming some royal commission, but as the
power of Charlemagne's feeble rulers dwindled, Heribert's
heirs presently forgot almost all their allegiance
to their distant royal "master." This was merely as
seemed the case about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 900 all through the region
then coming to be called "France." Castles were rising
everywhere, sometimes to repel the vikings, sometimes
merely to strengthen the power of some local chief.
Once erected, the lords of those castles were really little
princes, able to defy the very weak central authority.
To capture a considerably less formidable fortalice than
St. Aliquis implied a tedious siege, such as few kings
would undertake save in an emergency.</p>

<p>The result was that ere <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1000 Heribert's great-grandsons
had almost ceased to trouble about the king.
The person they genuinely feared was the local Duke
of Quelqueparte, another feudal seigneur with more
followers and more castles than they. Partly from
prudence, partly from necessity, they had "done homage"
to him, become "his men," and as his vassals rode to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
his wars. The dukes, in turn, full of their own problems,
and realizing the strength of St. Aliquis, seldom interfered
in the fief, save on very serious occasions. The
barons of St. Aliquis therefore acted very nearly like
sovereign princes. They, of course, had their own gallows
with power of life and death, waged their own personal
wars, made treaties of peace, and even coined a little
ill-shapen money with their own superscription.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> "Barons
by the Grace of God," they boasted themselves, which
meant that they obeyed the duke and <em>his</em> suzerain, the
king, very little, and, we fear, God not a great deal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Turbulent Barons</div>

<p>In the recent centuries, however, the barony had
changed hands several times. About 1070 the lord had
the folly to refuse his ordinary feudal duty to the Duke
of Quelqueparte. The latter roused himself, enlisted
outside aid, and blockaded and starved out the castle
of St. Aliquis. The unfortunate baron&mdash;duly adjudged
"traitor and felon" by his "peers," his fellow vassals&mdash;was
beheaded. The duke then bestowed the fief, with
the hand of the late owner's niece, upon Sire Rainulf,
a younger son of a south-country viscount, who had
visited the duke's court, bringing with him an effective
battle-ax and fifty sturdy followers. Sire Rainulf, however,
died while in the First Crusade. The reigning duke
next tried to give the barony to another favorite warrior,
but the son of the late baron proved himself of sturdy
stuff. He fought off his suzerain and enlisted allies
from Burgundy. The duke was forced, therefore, to
leave him in peace.</p>

<p>Presently, about 1140, another baron died, survived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>only by a daughter. Her uncles and cousins did their
best to expel this poor lady and induced the suzerain
duke to close his eyes to their deeds, but, fortunately,
the new baroness had been very pious. The influence
of the great St. Bernard of Clairvaux was exerted,
thereby persuading King Louis VII to warn the duke
that if he could not protect his vassals "the king would
do justice." So the Lady Bertrada was given in marriage
to a respectable Flemish cavalier Gui, who ruled
the barony with only the usual wars. He left two sons,
Garnier and Henri. Sire Henri, the younger, lived at
the inferior castle of Petitmur, went on the Fourth
Crusade (1203-04), and perished in the fighting around
Constantinople ere the French and Venetians sacked
the city. Garnier, the elder, received, of course, the
great castle. He was the uncle of the Baron Conon III,
the son of Henri, and the present lord of St. Aliquis.</p>

<p>It is well said by the monks that the blessed feel joys in
paradise all the keener because a little earlier they have
escaped from the pangs and fires of purgatory. Certes, for
all laymen and clerics on the St. Aliquis fiefs, there was
purgatory enough in Baron Garnier's day to make the
present "sage" rule of Baron Conon seem tenfold happy.</p>

<p>The late seigneur ruled about twenty years, filled
up with one round of local wars, oppression of the small,
and contentions with the great. Baron Garnier was
assuredly a mighty warrior. Never was he unhorsed in
jousting or in m√™l√©e. His face was one mass of scars
and he had lost an ear. Plenty of landless knights and
wolfish men at arms rioted around his donjon. His
provosts and foresters knew how to squeeze the poor of
the seigneury, and by this income and by the ransoms from
numerous captives he was able to rebuild the castle of
St. Aliquis according to the first military art of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Crimes of Baron Garnier</div>

<p>But his sins were more than the hairs of his grizzled
head. Having taken dislike to his wife, and the bishop
refusing an annulment, he kept the poor Lady Ada
mewed up in one chamber for years, and, according to
many stories, loaded her with chains and spared not
tortures, until in mercy she died. However, he had
plenty of less regular consorts. The castle courts had
swarmed with loud women, the favorites of himself and
his familiars, and with their coarse, unacknowledged
brats. No pretty peasant girl's honor was safe in those
parts. As for the prisoners&mdash;after Messire Conon came
into power it was a marvel the quantity of human bones,
gnawed by the rats, which they took out of the lower
dungeons, as well as how they released four wretches
who had been incarcerated in the dark so long that they
were blinded. Needless to say, the compartments of the
gallows never lacked their swinging skeletons. Women
still hush their squalling children with, "Be silent&mdash;or
Baron Garnier will get you!"</p>

<p>Yet with all these deeds this baron affected great
hospitality. He kept a roaring hall, with ready welcome
for any cavalier who enjoyed deep drinking and talking
of horses, women, falcons, and forays; and a good many
seigneurs found his alliance useful. So he continued
his evil ways until (praised be Our Lady of Mercies)
he came to a fit end. Thrice he had been excommunicated
by the bishop. Thrice he had been readmitted
to ghostly favor, thanks to large gifts toward the new
cathedral at Pontdebois. Then he let his men murder
a priest who was traveling with a precious chalice. So
he was excommunicated a fourth time. While in this
perilous state (though boasting that he would soon make
his new terms with the Church) his companion in sin,
Suger of the Iron Arm, quarreled with him over their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>cups and ran him through with a boar spear. The
baron lived just long enough to see Suger hewn in
pieces by his comrades. Then he died (priestless, of
course, and unabsolved) cursing God and crying piteously
for help from the devil. Christians cross themselves
when they think of his fate hereafter.</p>

<p>Garnier left no legitimate children. He was on very
cold terms with his brother's widow, the Lady Odelina,
who was rearing her two sons and daughter at Petitmur;
but Odelina had faced her brother-in-law down and
clung tightly to her own little fief. She had given her
children a "courteous" and pious education, and induced
a neighboring seigneur to take her eldest son, Conon, to
"nourish" as his squire, and rear to be a knight. At length
came her reward. The youth was knighted by the Count
of Champagne three weeks before his evil uncle perished.
Then the suzerain duke was glad to have St. Aliquis pass
to so competent a vassal as young Sire Conon.</p>

<p>This is a bare suggestion of the contentions, feuds,
and downright wars of which the barony has been the
scene, and yet St. Aliquis has probably been freer from
such troubles than most of its neighbors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Baronial Fiefs and Vassals</div>

<p>Although this castle is the center of Baron Conon's
power, it is by no means his only strong place. He has
three other smaller castles (besides Petitmur, which
will go to his brother) that he sometimes inhabits, but
which he ordinarily rules through castellans. In the
twenty-odd villages upon the fief there are some ten thousand
peasants whom he governs through his provosts.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Also, there depend on him his own "noble" vassals&mdash;about
twelve "sires," petty nobles each with his own
small castle or tower, hamlet of peasants, and right to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>"low justice." These vassals follow the St. Aliquis
banner and otherwise contribute to the baron's glory.
That seigneur himself is likewise "advocate" (secular
guardian) of the neighboring Abbey of St. Aliquis&mdash;an
honorable post involving delicate dealings with the
lord abbot. Also, a few leagues away lies the "good
town" of Pontdebois. The baron, as will be explained,
has very important relations with that city. In addition
he "holds" of the bishop there resident some farms
with hunting and fishing rights. For this inferior fief
he does homage, of course, not to the Duke of Quelqueparte,
but to the Bishop of Pontdebois. Some years
previous, when the duke and bishop were at war, the
baron was obligated to send twenty knights to fight for
the duke, but also six to fight for the bishop. The
Scriptures warn us against trying "to serve two masters";
but the baron happily made shift to keep the two contingents
of his little array from engaging with one another
until his two overlords had made peace!</p>

<p>In addition to all the above, Conon holds still another
small castle at quite a distance, for which he does homage
to the Duke of Burgundy&mdash;a fact promising more
complications when Quelqueparte and Burgundy (as
is most likely) go to war. Finally, he holds a large
farm from his otherwise equal, the Baron of Harcourt.
Here he is sure to cut his feudal devoir to a minimum,
and leave the Lord of Harcourt to consider whether
to pocket his pride, risk a "private war," or attempt
a lawsuit before their mutual suzerain, the Duke of
Quelqueparte.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p>The Baron Conon would gladly be the direct vassal
of the king. The higher your suzerain the higher, on
the whole, your own glory in the feudal firmament;
but the duke would resent bitterly any attempt to get
his vassals away and all the other first-class nobles
would support him. Baron Conon must wait, therefore,
perhaps until the present elderly duke is dead and the
duchy falls under feeble heirs. Then he will find the
astute king, if Philip Augustus is still reigning, only too
willing and able to meet him halfway. At present,
however, Conon is on good terms with the duke, although
he is just as jealous himself to prevent his own sires from
"holding" directly from the duke as the latter is to
check the baron's going over to the king. Everywhere
there is this friction over "subinfeudation." "The
vassal of my vassal is <em>not</em> my vassal": that is the angry
comment daily.</p>

<p>All in all, the seigneury of St. Aliquis thus covers
three hundred square miles, whereof about one-third
is controlled by the baron as his personal domain and
the remainder by his vassals. Perhaps there are two
hundred similar baronies and countships dotting France,
some larger, some smaller, but in their histories, feudal
relationships, and general problems much alike. This
fief, however, is especially fortunate in that the baron
possesses an old charter, wrung from some tottering
Carolingian king, giving him the right to collect a sack
of grain, a large truss of hay, or a similar quota in kind
from every loaded barge traversing down the navigable
Claire; also to levy a copper obol for every
Christian foot passenger, and three obols for every
mounted traveler or Jew (mounted or walking) crossing
the very important bridge by the castle. These tolls
give messire many fine suits of armor, buy silk gowns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>for the baroness, and make all the local seigneurs
anxious to marry their daughters to the baron's sons
as soon as the boys can be knighted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Superior Type of Baron</div>

<p>St. Aliquis, we have said, is happy in its present
seigneur. Monks, villeins, and petty nobles agree in
praising Baron Conon. When a seigneur is practically
a sovereign, everything depends upon his character.
If the saints desire to punish certain Christians for
their sins, let them merely send them an evil, or only
an inefficient, quarrelsome baron! Like the unlamented
Garnier, he can soon make their lives into a perfect
Gehenna.</p>

<p>Conon III has now ruled for more than ten years.
He has kept out of all private wars but one, a feat almost
exceptional; but in that one war he struck so hard and
so skillfully that his opponent, the Viscount of Foretvert,
swore on the relics to a peace which cost him a village
of peasants and the transfer of two petty sires to the
St. Aliquis fealty. Conon fought also in the great
battle of Beauvais so as to win the personal praise of
the king himself. He compounded with the abbey over
the division of the income of a farm in a manner which
left him and the abbot firm friends&mdash;a singular piece
of diplomacy. Better still, he held to his point about
some hunting rights with the Bishop of Pontdebois, and
finally won most of his claims without being even
temporarily subjected to excommunication. His peasants
pay their imposts loyally, for the baron not merely
protects them from the raids of brigands and rival
feudatories; he also represses worse pillagers still, his
own seigneurial officers, who were ravaging harpies in
all the little thatched villages through Baron Garnier's
day. Therefore, Conon is called "a very gentle seigneur,"
which means that he is every inch a lord and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>which term does not prevent him from swinging a heavy
sword, and from knocking down a villein with his own
fist when there is need of teaching a lesson.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Baronial Family</div>

<p>As for Conon's family, his good mother, Lady Odelina,
is now resting under the stones of the abbey church;
but she lived to see her first-born wedded to Adela, the
daughter of a rich Picard sire, a dame of many virtues.
The marriage has been blessed with two healthy sons,
Fran√ßois and Anseau&mdash;the pampered tyrants of all the
castle folk. The baron's household also includes his
younger brother Aimery, who has just reached the age
for knighthood, and his marriageable sister Alienor. So
far the family had been marvelously harmonious.
There has been none of those passages at arms between
elder and younger brothers which often make a castle
the antechamber to hell. Adela is "the very <em>gentle</em>
dame"&mdash;beloved of husband and revered by vassals
and villeins, but whose "gentleness," like her husband's,
by no means keeps her from flogging her maids when
their sins deserve it. Alienor is already going to tourneys
and has presented at least three young knights with
her stockings to tie to their lances; but she knows that
it is a brother's duty to find a husband for one's sister,
and Conon has promised that whoever he selects will
be young, brave, and kindly. Therefore Alienor is not
borrowing trouble. As for Aimery, he is proud of being
almost as good a hawker and jouster as his brother.
He will soon be knighted and rule over Petitmur, but
his head is full of a visit to the king's court, of winning
vast favor, and finally of being given the only daughter
and heiress of a great count&mdash;in short, of possessing a
fief bigger than St. Aliquis.</p>

<p>There, then, is the little world, ruled by persons
perhaps a little more honorable and kindly than the run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
of North French barons, but by no means of impossible
virtue.</p>

<p class="mb2">It is June, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1220. The sun is just rising. Let
us enter St. Aliquis as the warders unbar the gates;
for the castle is the heart of the feudal civilization.</p>

<h2>Chapter II: The Castle of St. Aliquis.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_031.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">T</span>he castle makes the feudal ages possible.
It is because western Europe is covered
with thousands of strongholds, each of
which can stand off a considerable army,
that we have the secular institutions
of the thirteenth century. To be the
owner and lord of at least one castle is the dream of
every nobleman, and in fact until he can hoist his own
banner from his own donjon he hardly has a defined
place in the feudal hierarchy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Castle of St. Aliquis</div>

<p>As we have seen, the castle of St. Aliquis is now nearly
three hundred and fifty years old. Since it has been
continuously inhabited by enterprising owners, its
structure has been as continuously changing. However,
if we had come to the barony only fifty years ago, we
would have found a decidedly primitive structure. The
general plan of Heribert's original stronghold was then
still retained: first, on the landward side of the triangle
above the two converging rivers there was a rather
deep moat, next a parapet whereof the lower part was
made of earth taken from this same moat, and upon
the mound rose a strong palisade of tree trunks. Within
the palisade were barns, outbuildings, and barracks for
such of the baron's men as did not live in the inner
stronghold. Then last of all was the donjon, the castle
proper&mdash;a huge square tower built with little art, but
which defied attack by mere solidity. The entrance to
this grim tower was by a steep inclined plane leading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>to a small door in the second story. In case of danger,
if the palisade were forced, the seigneur and his men
retreated into the tower, knocked down the wooden
gangway, and shouted defiance to the enemy. The mass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>and height of the donjon baffled any ordinary methods
of attack save that of blockade and starvation&mdash;and
there would be six months' supply of wheat, salt beef,
and ale in the tower vaults.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_032"></a>
  <img src="images/i_032.jpg" width="400" height="549" alt="TYPICAL CASTLE OF THE MIDDLE AGES" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">TYPICAL CASTLE OF THE MIDDLE AGES</p>
<p class="center">(Without large barbican court)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Nevertheless, this seemingly impenetrable fortress
did not suffice. In the first place, superior methods of
siege warfare were developing: the stoutest fortifications
could be cracked.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the next place, if the donjon were
hard to enter, it was almost equally hard to sally forth
from it. No rapid sortie could be made from the door in
the second story; the defense must be wholly passive.
Finally, this stark masonry tower was a most uncomfortable
place, with its cavernous "halls" barely lighted
by tiny loopholes, frigid in winter, stifling in summer,
unsanitary&mdash;in short, almost intolerable for habitation
by a large body of men. After the First Crusade (1094-99)
numerous cavaliers came home with great tales of
the fortresses of the Byzantines and the Saracens.
During the twelfth century, consequently, castle architecture
underwent a remarkable transformation. Richard
the Lion Hearted built Ch√¢teau Gaillard in Normandy.
His mighty rival, Philip Augustus, built the
famous Louvre to dominate Paris, and erected other
new-style castles with cylindrical towers at Montargis,
Poissy, Dourges, and elsewhere. Already by 1220 the
plans are being drawn for a great castle at Coucy (built
between 1223 and 1230) which is to be almost a model
for all subsequent fortress builders, until the advent
of gunpowder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Castle Rebuilt Scientifically</div>

<p>Baron Garnier, whatever his crimes, had certainly
understood the art of war. He rebuilt St. Aliquis in a
thoroughly scientific manner, employing a learned
masterbuilder and "sage," an elderly Fleming who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>seen the best fortifications of the Infidels and had lived
long in those famous Syrian-Christian fortresses like
Krak des Chevaliers, which by the mere excellence of
construction had enabled small garrisons of western
"Franks" to defy the full power of Saladin. Instead
of a mere ditch, palisade, and then a single vast tower,
St. Aliquis has consequently become a huge complex
of defenses within defenses, each line of resistance a
little harder to penetrate and with every outwork
commanded by an inner fortification. If at last you
come to the central donjon, it still looms up above you&mdash;defiant
and formidable, and you can have your fill of
desperate fighting, only perhaps to be bloodily repulsed
in the end. Of course, the donjon can indeed be starved
out, but it is not very often that any enemy of St.
Aliquis will have resources and persistence enough to
keep his troops together until the castle supplies are
exhausted. He must either get possession pretty quickly
or not at all&mdash;and Garnier's Fleming certainly took
pains he should not get in quickly!</p>

<p>In examining St. Aliquis or its rivals, one must remember
that they are the creations of men who have devoted
most of their thought to the problems of war. Every
possible contingency has been anticipated. The architect
and his employer have practically spent their lives
studying "how can a castle be made to hold out as long
as possible?" Being, despite their sins, highly intelligent
men, it is not surprising that they produce remarkable
results.</p>

<p>We are approaching the castle as the morning mists
are lifting from the Claire and the Rapide. Ahead of us,
out of the dispersing fog, is rising what seems a bewildering
mass of towers, walls, battlements gray and brown,
with here and there a bit of green, where a little earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
has been allowed to lodge and a few weeds shoot forth.
High above all soars the mass of the great central tower,
the donjon, from the summit of which Baron Conon's
banner is now idly trailing.</p>

<p>We come down a road that takes us over the toll
bridge across the Rapide and find ourselves in a kind
of parade ground where there are only a few cattle sheds
and possibly a rude cabin or two for such of the baron's
herdsmen as must sleep outside overnight. This open
ground is the scene for martial exercises, rallyings of
the vassals, and even for tournaments. Many people
are headed toward the castle, mostly from the village
of peasants just westward across the river; but there
is also the subprior on a mule, riding over from the abbey,
and also a messenger who has spurred down very early
from Pontdebois with a communication from the bishop.
As we near the castle its tower and inner and outer
wards become more distinct. We readily believe that
it took Garnier's architect three years to carry through
the work; that all the peasants of the barony had been
put to grievous <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corv√©es</i> (forced labor) digging, hewing
and dragging stone, or working the great derricks; and
that ten expert stonecutters and fully eighty less skilled
masons had been hired in from Paris, Rheims, and
Orl√©ans, besides a master mason who demanded rewards
that seemed outrageous for a mere villein and not for
a belted knight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Barbican and Lists</div>

<p>These speculations end as we come, not to the castle,
but to a semicircular palisade inclosing the regular gate
on the landward side. This palisade is too high to
scramble over; the piles are too sharply pointed and
stout enough to stand considerable battering. This
outwork is the barbican&mdash;the first of the long series of
obstacles awaiting the foe. Of course, it could not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>defended in a regular siege, but its purpose is to stop
any surprise attack long enough to enable the garrison
to rally, close the great gate, and man the walls. The
whole crowd of folk now entering make for the heavy
wooden barrier which is just being thrown open by a
rather sleepy porter. Since it is a time of profound
peace, he lets them all stream inside, merely requiring
everyone to leave his weapons in his custody. We pass
unchallenged, thanks to the kind <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">f√©e</i> aforementioned,
who has rendered us as invisible as the owner of Gyges's
ring. If, however, we had been guests of noble rank,
we would have proceeded onward to the inner gate and
rung loudly on a heavy metal gong hanging there.
One of the baron's squires would then have greeted us.
If we had been the baron's equal or superior in the
social scale, Conon himself would next have come down
to lead us in; if somewhat inferior, we would have been
conducted by the squire to the great hall, where we
would have removed hood and gloves before the magnate
presented himself. But we have much to examine ere
we penetrate the seigneurial hall.</p>

<p>Once inside the barbican, one discovers that between
this extreme barrier and the fortress proper there is
another open space with a road, and another place for
equestrian exercises extending from the Claire straight
over to the abrupt slopes of the Rapide. The palisades
run all the way from river to river. This space within
the barbican forms the lists, where two young sergeants
are breaking in a balky stallion. The lists are a great
convenience in peace time, but the real utility is in war,
and they are even more important in the castles that
have land on every side. They supply a good road by
which men can be hurried round the castle circuit in
reasonable safety. On the other hand, if the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
suddenly forces the barriers, he finds himself most
awkwardly in a limited space between the palisade and
the castle moat, with all the arbalists (crossbows)
playing on him from the walls above.</p>

<p>Inside the lists and next to the masonry walls runs the
moat. It is some twenty feet wide, partly filled now with
scum-covered rain water. In the spring the varlets
have great joy here hunting frogs, but as the year
advances it assuredly breeds mosquitoes. It constitutes,
however, another formidable barrier to an enemy, and
that is its sole object.</p>

<p>After crossing these lists, the path leads straight to
the drawbridge. This has just been lowered by means
of heavy counterpoises swung on a kind of trestle overhead,
for even in peace times no seigneur will sleep
soundly before the drawbridge is up. The portcullis,
the frame of iron bars which is lowered whenever the
bridge is raised, has also been hoisted in its groove
by the gateway. The heavy oaken gates, faced with
metal, have not been unbarred, however. A smaller
door, just big enough for a horse, has been opened in
one of them, admitting to the castle proper. Despite
the earlier scrutiny at the barbican, one now catches a
watchful eye at the small window in the turret close
beside the portcullis. The chief porter has a very
responsible position. Many a fortress has been lost
because he has been careless or unfaithful. He would,
in any case, be chargeable if he admitted unwelcome
guests or idle rascals. Porters are often accused of being
gruff, insolent, fat, and lazy, but part of their bad
name comes because they have to repel bad characters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bailey, Gates and Towers</div>

<p>And now we are about to enter the outer ward, or
bailey, of the castle of St. Aliquis. The walls and towers
of these outer defenses are less formidable than those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>of the inner ward; yet they seem of massive thickness
and imposing altitude. There is a solid round tower
covering either side of the gate; to about fifteen feet
these twain rise above the moat naked and sheer, then
are pierced with narrow slits intended, not to let in
light, but to permit archers to cover every inch of the
way from the barbican to the drawbridge. Even if
the foe should cross the moat, shatter the portcullis, and
split open the heavy doors, he would be merely at the beginning
of terrible hours of ax- and sword-play. He would
be in a narrow and low vaulted passage, with many
loopholes on either side for archers, and also with slits
in the ceiling for pouring down boiling oil, seething pitch,
molten lead, and other pleasantries; and if he rushed past
all these forms of death into the courts, there, behind
him, capable still of very stout defense, would rise the
two strong gate towers, rendering every attempt to re-enforce
the original attacking party a dice-throwing
with death, and making retreat equally dangerous.
Few leaders, therefore, will be foolish enough to try to
storm St. Aliquis simply by a desperate rush against
the gate.</p>

<p>From the two gate towers, right and left, there extends
a considerable stretch of sheer wall terminating at
either extremity with two more towers which mark the
corners on the landward side of the fortress. These
four towers, of course, by projecting far beyond this
curtain wall, are posted so as to permit a steady fire of
missiles on any enemy who may somehow ensconce himself
close under the wall. The two sections of curtain
wall themselves are some dozen feet thick, with a firm
walk along their summit, protected by a stone parapet.
To enable the defenders, however, to drop stones and
other forms of destruction upon attackers who may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
under the very base of the wall and defying the bolts
from the towers, a structure of heavy timbers can be
built out all along the wall overhanging the moat.
These wooden hordings are strong enough to withstand
many stones from the casting engines, but they can
sometimes be set on fire. In a siege, therefore, they will
be covered with raw hides. The same will also be put
over the conical wooden roofs which cap the towers.
Since this is a time of peace, however, the hordings
stand weather-stained and bare. To cover the entire
woodwork with hides will be one of the first tasks of the
garrison in case of a serious alarm.</p>

<p>As we survey the outer walls of the castle, it is clear
that no enemy will try to batter down the towers. Even
if he could penetrate their shells, he would merely find
himself in a dark, cavernous, vaulted chamber, with
the defenders flinging down death from above. He
would then have to bore through the inner wall, nearest
the court, under every disadvantage. The towers are
built so completely of masonry that it is impossible to
burn them. Winding stairs, leading up through the
stonework, conduct from one stage to another; and
these staircases are so narrow and tortuous that a single
warrior with an ordinarily lively ax can stop a hundred
men ascending.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The attack, therefore, must be on the
curtain walls. But even here, supposing one has scaled
the battlements, more troubles are awaiting. The only
way downward from the curtain walls is through the
towers at the end of the parapets. To leap into the court
inside means broken bones. The gangways along the
parapet are intercepted at several points by wooden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>bridges. These can be easily knocked away, leaving
yawning gaps defying any leaper. If you reach the
towers they are all barred, and the arbalists are shooting
down on the captured gangways from a dozen loopholes.
Finally, be it said, each tower is a little fortress by
itself. It has its own cistern, fireplace for cooking, and
storeroom. Even if isolated, its garrison can hold out
stoutly. So much for the task of attacking merely the
outer ward of St. Aliquis.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 369px;"><a id="i_040"></a>

  <span class="caption">VIEW OF THE COURT AND THE DONJON</span>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Inner Court and Donjon</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>The problems of the towers and the curtain wall
detain one long, for they sum up the fundamental
principles of thirteenth-century fortifications. But now
before us opens the broad court of the bailey itself, the
scene of much of the homely life of the castle; in fact,
the place now swarms with people busy with all kinds
of activities. The pavement is none too clean. There
are large muck piles, and one sees hens and a few
pigs and dogs foraging everywhere. A genuine village
really exists inside the bailey. To the right of the gate
is a rambling, thatched-roof stable where in a long
row of stalls the fifty-odd horses of the seigneur are
champing their morning fodder. Near the stables
stand tall ricks of hay. Behind these are a second line
of inelegant wooden structures: they are the barracks
for the less favored castle servitors, and for a part of the
heavy-handed men at arms whom Baron Conon keeps
for instant duty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buildings and Life in the Bailey</div>

<p>On the left side of the gate are several more buildings.
To be noted are a commodious carpenter shop where
saw and hammer are already plying; a well-appointed
smithy where at one ringing forge the baroness's white
palfrey is being reshod, and at another the master
armorer is putting a new link into a mail shirt. The
castle smith's position is no sinecure. He has to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
a great quantity of weapons and armor in constant
order; he has to do all the recurring small jobs around
the great establishment; and in emergency to manufacture
quantities of lance heads and arbalist bolts, as
well as perhaps to provide the metal work for siege
engines on which may rest the fate of the castle. Conon's
first armorer is accordingly one of the most important
and best rewarded of all the servitors.</p>

<p>Besides these workshops there is a long storehouse, a
repository for not merely the food, but all other kinds
of supplies needful in a siege. Near by stands a smaller,
shedlike structure, puzzling at first to strangers, but
which explains itself by the shrill screams and cries
issuing thence. It is the baron's hawk house, the mews,
where the chief falconer is now feeding the raw meat to
the great hawks and falcons in which his noble masters
take delight. Close to these secular buildings, however,
there rises somewhat incongruously an elegant Gothic
chapel, with soaring pinnacles, a rose window at the end
of the small nave, sculptured saints flanking the portal,
and within one finds glorious stained glass, more saints'
images and carvings, and a rich altar. This is the
little castle church to which very many dwellers of St.
Aliquis, including messire and madame, had repaired
piously at gray dawn, and where now good Father
Gr√©goire has just finished a rather hasty mass.</p>

<p>The bailey, in short, is overrunning with activities.
Horses are neighing, cows are being milked, an overladen
donkey is braying. Yonder in one corner is a
small building with a tall chimney. Here is the seigneur's
great oven, whither not merely the castle folk, but a
great number of the peasants, resort to bake their
bread. In front of the chapel bubbles a little fountain,
and chattering women, scantily attired, are filling their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
water pots. Children in various degrees of nakedness and
dirtiness play everywhere. Noises of every kind blend in
a hubbub. Lastly we notice, close to the inner drawbridge,
another building again with a tall chimney. This
is the castle cookhouse, where the dinners are prepared
for the great hall within. A glance through the door
shows the vast fireplace where one can roast a whole
sheep or a small beef entire. The cookhouse is located
here because of the danger of fire in the inner castle,
and because the position is convenient for the great number
of the servitors who must eat in their barracks. When
it is mealtime, however, this arrangement compels a
prodigious running to and fro all through the dinner
hour between kitchen and hall on the part of the twenty-odd
sergeants and squires who serve Baron Conon's
guests and family. It bothers not the appetites of
pious Christians that their food is cooked amid contending
odors and that many of the doings near the cookhouse
make its condition extraordinarily unsanitary.</p>

<p>We have now crossed the bailey and its teeming life.
Before us rises the inner ward of the castle. Here are
the gate and the walls of the bailey over again, but far
more pretentious and formidable. There is another
moat filled with muddy water; another drawbridge
larger than the outer one. The two gate towers are
higher; their structures are thicker, more solid. The
curtain walls are so lofty that arbalistiers thereon can
pick off the enemy who may have gained the parapet
of the outer defenses. Finally, between the gate towers
and the towers at the end of the curtains, both to right
and left, there is interposed an extra tower, making
the flanking fire much more close and deadly. Consequently,
the foe who could force his way into the
bailey would thus probably find it merely a bloody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>cockpit. The retreating garrison would set fire to all
the rude wooden buildings, and rake the outer court
with their bows and engines. If it would cost dearly
to win the bailey, what would it not cost to storm
the castle proper?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inner Court, Donjon and Palais</div>

<p>The gate to the inner ward is flung wide, but the
portcullis still slides in its grooves, being dropped every
night to make sure that low fellows from the barracks
do not prowl around the seigneurial residence in the
darkness. Just at present swarms of people are going
to and fro between the two great sections of the castle,
and jostling and laughing in the narrow passages.
As we pass through to the inner ward we realize a certain
touch of refinement. The pavement is cleaner. Most
of the servitors are better dressed and better mannered.
Before us opens the great court of the castle, set with
stone flags and reasonably well swept. Here the baron
and his brother will practice their martial exercises when
the weather is bad and they must avoid the tilting
grounds. Here the horses will be mounted when Conon,
Adela, and all their noble friends assemble to ride out
for hunting or hawking. On either side the stately
towers set into the walls frown downward, but our gaze
is ahead. Straight before one rises first a rather elegant
stone building with large pointed windows and a high
sloping roof, and then looming before that an enormous
round citadel&mdash;one that dwarfs all the other towers.
It stands at the apex of the triangle; on one side is the
castle court, but to right and left the crags at its base
are falling precipitously away to the Rapide and the
Claire.</p>

<p>The stone building is the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">palais</i>, the actual residence
of the baron. The giant tower is the donjon, the great
keep of the castle, built on the site of Heribert's old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
stronghold, but twenty times as formidable. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">palais</i>
is nearest to us, but since the apartments of the seigneur
are there, and we wish to examine these later, it is
best to pass around one end thereof and visit the donjon
first.</p>

<p>Baron Garnier had built his donjon about one hundred
and ten feet high and some fifty-five feet in diameter,
with walls a dozen feet thick. This size is large, but
not extraordinary. At Coucy they are planning a
tower two hundred and twenty-five feet high and
ninety-five feet in diameter. If Garnier had built
a little earlier he would have made it square, like
that pitiless tower at Loches, which is only one
hundred feet high, but is seventy-six feet on its
longest side. To enter the donjon we go over still
another drawbridge, although the ditch below is dry,
and on penetrating a small door in the masonry we
wind up a passageway through the thick wall. Passing
from the bright morning light of the court, one seems
plunged into pitchy darkness. Strangers stumble up
steep stairways, with here and there a twinkle of light
from loopholes a couple of feet high, although barely
wide enough at their openings to allow the free flight of
an arrow. Far below may be caught glimpses of the
twinkling, rushing Rapide, and of the bright green
country stretching away in the distance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Donjon</div>

<p>When St. Aliquis was rebuilt by Baron Garnier's
architect, although the donjon was greatly improved,
much of the old masonry of the original tower was
retained, as well as the general arrangement of the
staircases, loopholes, and succession of <em>halls</em>, chambers,
and lofts. We see what the castle resembled in
Heribert's day. By a turn or two in the gaunt entrance
we come to the original great hall of the castle. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>offensively dark; the windows are mere loopholes at
the end of deep, cone-shaped passages let into the walls.
Even on this balmy June morning the atmosphere is
clammy. As our eyes adjust themselves, however,
we see that we are in a huge vaulted chamber with a
great fireplace, and with a kind of wooden gallery
about eight feet above the floor, around the entire
circuit. In this great chamber can be assembled a good
fraction of the entire garrison. The seigneur or his
spokesmen standing in the center or near the fireplace
can give orders which every man present can understand.
Directions can thus be given for any move needful for
the defense of the castle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 355px;"><a id="i_046"></a>
  <img src="images/i_046.jpg" width="355" height="598" alt="UPPER HALL OF THE DONJON" />
  <span class="caption">UPPER HALL OF THE DONJON</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>As we shall see, there is now a newer and better hall
in the more modern and airy <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">palais</i>, but the older hall
is still used at great feasts for the overflow of guests.
Even now are standing long oaken tables, duly hacked
by the trencher knives of many boisterous diners; and
on the walls&mdash;blackened by the smoke from the great
fireplace&mdash;are hanging venerable trophies of the chase,
antlers, the head of a bear, great boar tusks, as well as
an array of all kinds of hunting weapons used by departed
generations.</p>

<p>If we were to follow the staircase down from the hall
we would come to an even darker vaulted apartment
used sometimes as a supplementary dormitory for the
humbler guests, but also (to the astonishment of later-day
medical usage) with small rooms set off to be used
as a kind of sick ward; because every physician, whether
schooled at Salerno, Cordova, or Montpellier, will tell
you that darkness is the friend of health and that few
invalids can hope to get better unless they are kept as
shaded and sequestered as possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Prison and the Watch Tower</div>

<p>If we wished to pursue still lower, descending a black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>staircase with lanterns, the rocks would begin to drip
dampness. We could hear the rushing of the Rapide
against the base of the castle. The journey would end
at a barred iron door. Within would be a fetid, reeking
chamber lit only by two or three tiny chinks in the
masonry, and with the bare rock for the floor. Here is
Baron Conon's prison. He is counted a merciful seigneur,
yet he thinks nothing of thrusting genuine offenders
therein and keeping them for weeks, if not months,
before releasing or hanging. Lucky if Ma√Ætre Denis,
the turnkey, remembers to bring down a coarse loaf
each day, and if the rats do not devour the prisoners'
toes; but we shall consider all such nice matters later<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>It is alleged that from these lower vaults there is an
underground passage leading from the castle to a secret
sallyport at the foot of the precipice by the Rapide.
If a passage exists, however, it is known only to Conon
and a very few trusted retainers. But not all such
stories are false; many castles have such secret passages;
and at Coucy they are quietly planning to introduce a
rather elaborate system of the same. Quite possibly
St. Aliquis possesses something of this nature.</p>

<p>Far pleasanter is it now to ascend from the main
hall through a couple of stages of upper and airier
chambers (now used as apartments by part of the castle
folk) until by a dizzy ladder we reach the summit of the
donjon itself. Here on one edge of the broad platform
is a little round turret carrying us still higher. From
the turret flutters the orange banner of St. Aliquis, with
some kind of a black dragon (in memory, possibly,
of the viking raid) broidered upon it, and the arrogant
legend of the noble family, "Rather break than bend."
To lower this banner were a horrid disgrace. Never is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>it to be struck unless the castle surrenders, when it will
be sadly flung into the moat.</p>

<p>Under the flagstaff is a stout projecting beam rigged
with a pulley. Here is a gibbet in case the baron wishes
to hang offenders as a warning for the countryside.
Fortunately, however, Adela has a dislike to seeing the
corpses dangling, and has persuaded Conon to order
his recent hangings at the ordinary gallows across the
Claire by the village. On the flag turret is always a
watchman; day or night some peasant must take his
turn, and even in peace he has no sinecure. He must
blow on his great horn at sunrise, at "cover fire" at
night, when the baron's hunt rides out and returns,
and again when a strange retinue approaches the gate.
The whole wide countryside spreads in a delightful
panorama below him at present, but on winter nights,
when every blast is howling around the donjon, the task
is less grateful. No wonder that peasants impressed
for this service complain that "watchmen have the lot
of the damned."</p>

<p>So back through the donjon and again to the castle
court. The donjon is purely military. In times of
peace it is a mere storehouse, prison, and supplementary
barrack for the seigneur's people. In war it is the last
position where the garrison can stand desperately at
bay. A hundred years earlier Adela and her sister-in-law,
Alienor, would have lived out most of their days
in the cheerless dark chambers directly above the main
hall. Now they are more fortunate. They dwell in the
elegant Gothic arched <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">palais</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Great Hall of the Palais</div>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">palais</i> consists of a long, somewhat narrow building
thrusting out into the inner court, and of other
structures resting against the western curtain wall on
one side, but with their larger inner windows looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>also into the court. The rooms are high, with enormous
fireplaces where great logs can warm the apartments in
winter. The ceilings are ribbed and vaulted like a church,
and some of the masonry is beautifully carved. Where
the bare walls are exposed they are often covered with a
stucco on which are sketched fresco scenes somewhat
after the style of stiff Byzantine paintings, or the famous
tapestry of Queen Mathilde at Bayeux. All the tints
are flat red, yellow, or brown, without perspective or fine
lines, and in a kind of demi-silhouette. Little touches
of green, violet, and blue relieve the bareness, and
despite many awkward outlines and other limitations
many of the scenes are spirited as well as highly decorative.
Some of the pictures are religious. We notice
"Christ on the Cross" between the "Synagogue" and the
"New Law," a "Last Judgment," an episode in the life
of St. Aliquis himself; also many secular pictures based
often on the jongleur's epics. Thus from the "Song of
Roland" there is the tearing by wild horses of the traitor
Ganelon.</p>

<p>The windows in this <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">palais</i> betray the luxury of the
owner. They are not closed by wooden shutters, as are
most other apertures in the castle. They are of glass,
with very small panes set in lead. The panes in the
smaller rooms are uncolored, although hardly of transparent
whiteness, but in the huge dining hall they are
richly colored as in a church, giving a jewel-set galaxy
of patron saints (<i>e.g.</i>, St. Martin, the warrior saint of
France) and of knights and paladins from Charlemagne
and King Artus down, gazing benignantly upon the
feasters below.</p>

<p>This new hall is, of course, the finest apartment in the
castle. Here amid wood- and stone-work deeply carved
the baron's household sits down to dinner. It is, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
more than a mere dining room. Great feudal ceremonies,
such as the receiving of homage, here take place. Hither
also in bad weather or on winter evenings nearly all the
castle folk will resort. Messire will sit on the dais upon
his canopied chair; everybody else will wedge in as
closely as possible, and after infinite chatter, jesting,
dice playing, and uproar the ever-popular jongleurs
will take station near the fireplace, do their tricks,
sing songs, or recite romances. The hall is, in short,
the focus of the peaceful life of the castle.</p>

<p>There are other rooms in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">palais</i>, but, considering
the number of people who have to live therein, they
seem rather few. There is little real privacy in St.
Aliquis. The baron has a special closet indeed, where
he can retire and hope that he is not overheard, but
the great chamber for himself and the baroness is
ordinarily full of servitors. Next to the chamber is a
second room where the baron's sons sleep while they
are little, and where honored guests can be lodged.
Conon's brother and sister have each a large apartment,
but there seems a singular lack of anterooms, boudoirs,
and other retiring rooms. It is perfectly good manners
to ask noble guests to share the same rooms with the
family; and a couple of the baroness's maids will sleep
on pallets within her chamber, with the baron's favorite
squire just outside the door. As for the lesser folk at
night, they often stretch unceremoniously on the tables
or even on the floor in the main hall. The possession
of a strictly private room is indeed a decided luxury;
even a great noble is often able to go without it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_052"></a>
  <img src="images/i_052.jpg" width="400" height="275" alt="INTERIOR OF A THIRTEENTH-CENTURY APARTMENT" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">INTERIOR OF A THIRTEENTH-CENTURY APARTMENT</p>
<p>From the restoration by Viollet-Le-Duc. At the left the chair where sits the seigneur, the bed separated by a screen
from the rest of the hall; at the back, between the two windows, a cupboard; opposite the fireplace, a large table. Tapestries
ornament the walls.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">Tables, Rushes and Tapestries in Hall</div>

<p>The furniture of these apartments seems scanty, but
it is at least very solid. In the hall there are lines of
tables set upon trestles, faced by long backless seats.
Here it is often needful to remove these tables to arrange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>for a feudal ceremony or for a dance; but at one end
of the apartment is a raised dais, and at right angles
to the others runs the ponderous oaken table of the
master. Conon faces the hall from a high carved chair
under a wooden canopy. The other seats on the dais
have the luxury of backs and arms. The fireplace is an
enormous construction, thrusting far into the room,
where long logs on high andirons can heat the stonework
so it will glow furiously for hours. To keep off the heat
in winter there are fire screens of osier, but of course in
summer these disappear. Every festival day the paved
floors of the rooms in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">palais</i> are strewn, if possible,
with new rushes and flowers&mdash;roses and lilies, flags and
mint, making a soft crackling mass under one's feet.
They are fragrant and pleasant while fresh, and even
through the winter are allowed to remain to protect
against the chill of the floor. By springtime they are
dried and are very filthy, for the diners throw their
bones and bits of bread and meat into them, and the
dogs and cats roaming about cannot devour all of such
refuse. Certain seigneurs, indeed are introducing the
use of "Saracen carpets," gorgeous rugs either imported
from the East or made up in France after imported
patterns; but these are an expensive innovation, and
Conon as yet keeps to his river rushes.</p>

<p>Of another luxury, however, he is rightly proud.
Stowed away in carefully guarded cupboards is a quantity
of admirable wall tapestries, some of the precious
sendal (taffeta) silk, some of hardly less valuable Sicilian
woolen stuff. Their designs are of blazing magnificence.
There is one of great elaboration showing "The Seven
Virtues and the Seven Vices," another giving a whole
sequence of scenes concerning Charlemagne. But such
precious ornaments must be kept for great occasions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
The order, "Hang the tapestries," is a sign to the servitors
that Conon contemplates a tourney or a great
feast or a visit from the duke. For to-day the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">palais</i>
contents itself with its simple fresco decoration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Furniture and Beds</div>

<p>The bedroom furniture is equally simple. The chamber
of the baron and his wife is lit by three windows with
arched tops pierced into the masonry, overlooking the
castle court. There is a little table by the fireplace
holding a board of chessmen and there are a few backless
stools and long narrow benches. In the window places
are comfortably upholstered "She and I" seats facing
one another. Opposite the fireplace is a chair of state
for the baron, with high carved back and arms, a wooden
canopy of equally heavy carving, and a footstool covered
with red silk. There are several ponderous wardrobes,
and especially a number of very massive iron-bound
chests containing valuable garments, jewels, and the
like. Bureaus and chests of drawers hardly exist in this
age, and ordinary chests take their place. Indeed, no
bedroom is fitted properly unless it has a solid chest at
the foot of the bed for the prompt reception of any
guest's belongings. When a castle is taken the cry,
"Break open the chests!" is equivalent to calling to the
victors, "Scatter and pillage!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_056"></a>
  <img src="images/i_056.jpg" width="400" height="505" alt="A THIRTEENTH CENTURY BED" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A THIRTEENTH CENTURY BED</p>
<p class="center">Reconstructed by Viollet-Le-Duc, from a
manuscript in the Biblioth√®que nationale.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Near one of the windows in the wall there is also
a large crucifix carved of dark wood, and beneath it
on a shelf is a small silver box richly chased with figures
of saints and angels. This is a reliquary containing a
trophy brought from the Holy Land by a crusader&mdash;a
cluster of hair of St. Philip the Apostle, likewise some
ravelings of the robe of St. Anna, mother of the Virgin.
Before these sacred objects the baron and baroness
kneel on red-silk cushions and say their prayers morning
and night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>But the central object of the chamber is the bed. To
have a fine bed for the master and mistress is the ambition
of every feudal household. It stands under a great
canopy, with heavy
curtains of blue taffeta.
The bed itself, a
great mass of feather
mattresses and gorgeously
embroidered
coverlets, projects its
intricately carved
footboard far into the
room. The whole
structure is set upon
a platform. When the
baron and baroness
have retired, their attendants
will pull the
thick curtains and
practically inclose
them in their own
secluded bedroom.
The curtains cut off air, but that is no disadvantage,
because every physician tells you that night air is
most unhealthful.</p>

<p>This nearly completes the furnishings of the chamber,
save for various perches, wooden hooks, and racks set
here and there for clothes and sometimes for the baroness's
hunting hawks, and two bronze lamps swinging
on chains, which give a very imperfect illumination. If
more brilliance is needed (and if the great fireplace is not
throwing out a glare) one can do as they do in the great
hall for extra lighting&mdash;set resinous torches in metal
holders along the walls. However, for ordinary purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
the baron and baroness prefer the less odorous wax
candles. In fact, a very tall wax candle stands near to
the bed and is allowed to burn all night. This keeps
away pixies and the Devil, and makes things generally
more cheerful for Christians.</p>

<p>The other apartments of the castle are similarly
furnished, although with less magnificence. Of course,
in the barracks for the lower servitors and the men at
arms each man is lucky if he has a large bag crammed
with straw for a bed, a solid blanket, and a three-legged
stool whereon to sit by day.</p>

<p class="mb2">Thus have been inspected exterior, the stone, and the
wooden aspects of St. Aliquis. The task is next to see
the doings of the people who give to the unyielding
fortress its significance and life.</p>

<h2>Chapter III: How the Castle Wakes. Baronial
Hospitality.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_058.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">W</span>hatever the sins of the men of the
thirteenth century, they are not late
risers. The lamps and candles are so
poor that only rarely, when there is a
great festival or imperative work to be
performed, do persons remain about
many hours after sunset. In winter the castle folks
possibly spend nearly half of their entire time in bed;
in summer, thanks to the long evenings, they would
hardly get sufficient sleep save for a noon siesta.</p>

<p>Some seigneurs will actually rise considerably before
sunup, hear mass, mount their high turret, survey the
landscape, then descend to order the washing horn to be
blown. We hear, too, of ladies who rise at dusk, have
chaplains chant matins while they are throwing on
some clothes, then go to the regular chapel mass, next
complete their toilet and take a walk in their garden,
all before breakfast. There are, indeed, stories of noble
folk sleeping even in summer right up to 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, but
these backslidings follow only a deplorable carouse.
Conon and Adela are neither indefatigable risers, nor
among the slothful. They are seldom found in bed at
cock-crow, and the baron is already warning his young
sons that "he who sleeps too long in the morning becomes
thin and lazy." So at gray dawn William, Conon's first
body squire, has yawned on his pallet by the chamber
door, tugged on his own clothes, then hastened to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
great bed to assist his master to dress. This is one of a
good squire's prime duties, but he need not divest his lord
of any nightgown. Nightdresses are no more used in the
thirteenth century than are table forks. Conon has been
sleeping between the sheets, with only the clothing of a newborn
babe, although, curiously enough, he wraps around
his head a kind of napkin, precursor of the later nightcap.</p>

<p>When the baron has donned a part of his clothes Gervais,
the second squire, brings in a metal basin of water
and a white towel. The age is one of great contradictions
in matters of cleanliness. Baron Conon washes
his face and hands carefully and frequently. He also
takes complete baths pretty often, using large wooden
tubs filled with hot perfumed water. Personally he
seems an extraordinarily neat man, and so are all the
higher-rank people. But the age has never heard of
polluted wells and other breeding spots for malignant
fevers. Flies are harmless annoyances. Numerous evil
smells can hardly be prevented, any more than cold
weather&mdash;the saints give us grace to bear them! In short,
cleanliness stops with care of the person. Preventive
sanitation is as unknown as are the lands which may lie
across the storm-tossed Atlantic&mdash;"the Sea of Darkness."</p>

<p>There is an old rhyme which is supposed to give the
right times for the routine of the day:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Rise at five, dine at nine,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sup at five, to bed at nine,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is the way to live to be ninety and nine."</span>
</div></div>

<p>Sometimes dinner came later than nine, but never, if possible,
much after ten. People have sometimes become distressed
because the meal had to be postponed until noon.
This was natural, for everybody is stirring at daybreak and
for breakfast probably has had only a few morsels of bread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>washed down with thin wine&mdash;a poor substitute even for
the coffee and rolls of the later continental breakfast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Baron's Routine Business and Diversions</div>

<p>Having dressed and washed, the baron goes down to
mass at the chapel. Attending daily mass is a duty for
every really pious seigneur. One of Garnier's infamies
had been his gross irregularity in this matter. If there had
been no chapel in the bailey, the service could have been
held in a vestibule to the hall of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">palais</i>. After mass
is over, Conon is ready for business or pleasures. It is
a time of peace; and, truth to tell, the baron would really
be not a little glad of the excitement, bustle, and strenuous
preparation which come with the outbreak of war.
The list of things he can do to divert himself in times of
public quiet seems limited: He can hunt, fish, fence,
joust, play chess, eat and drink, listen to the songs of the
jongleurs, hold his court, walk in the meadows, talk
with the ladies, warm himself, have himself cupped and
bled, and watch the snow fall. This last amusement is
hardly practicable in June. Being bled is not commonly
reckoned a regular sport in other ages! Neither can he
hold court&mdash;receive his vassals and dispense justice&mdash;save
at intervals. The jongleurs ordinarily reserve themselves
for the evenings. Conon's secret hankering for a
war is, therefore, somewhat explicable.</p>

<p>If this is a fortunate day, however, the horn on the
turret will blow, and then the gong at the bailey gate will
reverberate. A visitor of noble rank has arrived. Nothing
can ordinarily be more welcome in castle communities.
Little isolated fractions of humanity as they are,
with the remainder of the world seemingly at an extreme
distance, the coming of a stranger means a chance to
hear news of the king's court, of the doings of the
Emperor Frederick II, of the chances of another crusade,
of the latest fashions in armor, of the newest methods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
of training hawks, nay, possibly of rumors of another
brave war like that which culminated in the glorious
battle of Bouvines. Unknightly, indeed, is the seigneur
who does not offer profuse hospitality to a noble visitor;
and any priest, monk, or law-abiding merchant will be
given a decent, though less ceremonious, welcome. No
wonder the inns everywhere are so bad, when the lords
of so many castles grow actually angry if a traveler will
not tarry perhaps for days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hospitality to Guests</div>

<p>There are stories of knights who have deliberately
caused the roads to be diverted to compel travelers to
come close to their castles, where they can be politely
waylaid and compelled to linger. Conon is not so absurd,
but if to-day a guest of noble rank approaches the castle,
all the ordinary routine ceases. At the outer gate the
strangers are met by William, the first squire. If he
reports that their chief is a baron, the visitors have the
gates unbarred before them; they ride straight over
both drawbridges to the inner court. Conon himself
leads in the horse of his chief guest, and when the visiting
nobleman dismounts he usually kisses him upon
mouth and chin, although, if the strange knight is an
elderly man, or of very exalted rank, he shows his
respect by kissing only his shoulders. Adela and her
maidens at once conduct the visitors to a chamber, where
the best feather beds are piled high in their honor, and
next skillfully take off their armor, bathe their feet,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and
even assist them to don loose clean clothes&mdash;a kind of
wrapper very pleasant for indoor wear. Meantime their
horses are being stabled and given every attention.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>Only after the visitors are dressed, refreshed, bathed,
and perhaps fed, will Conon courteously inquire for how
long he is to enjoy their company and whether they are
making St. Aliquis merely a stopping point or have come
to him on business.</p>

<p>Non-noble guests do not receive such ceremony, unless
they are high churchmen&mdash;bishops, abbots, and their
direct subordinates&mdash;but even a poor villein, if he
appears on a fit errand, is welcome to a solid meal and
a bed on the rushes in one of the halls.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> A jongleur is
always received heartily and entertained with the best;
the payment will be in songs and tricks after supper.
On most feast days, furthermore, the gates of St. Aliquis
will open wide. Conon's servitors will say to everyone,
"If you are hungry, eat what you please!" There will
be simply enormous gorging and guzzling at the baron's
expense.</p>

<p>Yet if there are no outside guests the baron is far from
being an idle man. Since he has been stirring at 4 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>
he is able to accomplish a great deal during the morning.
All the stables must be inspected; directions are given
about a brood mare; the noisy falcon house is surveyed;
various stewards, bailiffs, and provosts come in with
reports about the peasants, the baron's farms, and
especially the contention with a neighboring seigneur's
woodcutters about the right to take timber in a disputed
forest land&mdash;a case calling for major diplomacy to avoid
a brisk private war. Then, too, although this is not a
court day, the baron as the dispenser of justice has to
order two brawling peasants to be clapped in the stocks
until sundown, and to direct that an ill-favored lad
who had been caught in an honest villein's corn bin
shall have his ears cropped off.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>
<p>The castle is, in fact, an economic unit all by itself.
If the baron is idle or preoccupied he leaves its management
to deputies; but a good seigneur knows about
everything. The estate has its own corn lands and pasture,
its stacks of hay, its granaries and storehouses, its
mills, cattle byres, slaughter houses, and salting sheds.
Practically every scrap of food actually needed in the
castle is grown locally. The innumerable women and
varlets wear coarse woolen cloth made from wool raised,
sheared, carded, spun and woven on the seigneury. The
ordinary weapons and tools required in war are made at
the smithy in the bailey. The result is that the castle
people do very little buying and selling. Conon has a certain
income in silver deniers, but, except for the important
sums he is laying by for a tournament, his sister's
marriage, perhaps a private war, and other like occasions,
he spends it almost entirely on the finer articles of
clothing, for superior weapons, for cookery spices, and
for a few such luxuries as foreign wines. These can
be bought from visiting packmen or by a visit to Pontdebois
during the fair seasons.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> St. Aliquis therefore
presents what is to us a curious spectacle&mdash;a sizable
community wherein many of its members seldom handle
that thing called "money" from one month to another.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Comradery and Organization of Castle Folk</div>

<p>Conon, on many mornings, is thus kept busy adjusting
petty matters concerning the estate. The seigneur
is the center, the disposing power for the whole seigneury,
but he is not the despot. The castle is one huge family,
and shares its joys and troubles together. The upper
servitors hold their position by a kind of hereditary right.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>Guilbert, who presides over the smithy, is son of the
smith before him. In similar case are the chief cook, the
master huntsman, and many others. Even the dubious
post of baronial executioner is transmitted by a kind of
hereditary prerogative. For Conon to dismiss any of
these subordinates save for very obvious reasons would be
resented by all their fellows and produce a passive
rebellion unwelcome to the most arbitrary seigneur.
Even tyrannous Baron Garnier had to wait a suitable
opportunity ere changing an unwelcome servitor. Every
person has his own little sphere of influence and privilege.
The successful baron respects all these "rights" and
handles each inferior tactfully. The result is that there
is a great deal of comradery and plain speaking. The
baron and baroness must listen to flat contradictions
every day.</p>

<p>"You are absolutely wrong, Messire," says Herbert,
the cowherd, to-day, when Conon directs him to wean
certain calves. "I shall execute no such order." And
the baron (who would have fought a mortal duel with a
fellow noble ere accepting such language) wisely acquiesces,
with a laugh. Herbert is "his man" and as such
has his own sphere of action, and, besides, Herbert and
all his fellows will fight for their seigneur to the last
drop of their blood, and obey all strictly military orders
with touching fidelity.</p>

<p>Indeed, the St. Aliquis people are somewhat like
grown-up children. They are often angry, turbulent,
obstinate, contentious, even exchanging cuffs and blows.
The women are almost as passionate as the men. But
tempers cool with equal rapidity. Two varlets who
almost drew knives this morning will be communing
like twin brothers this afternoon. Furthermore, despite
much apparent friction, the three-hundred-odd people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
who sleep behind the walls of St. Aliquis are fairly well
organized. First of all the baron has his three squires,
youths of friendly baronial families who are being
"nourished" by Conon preparatory to knighthood and
whose education will be described later.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> They are, of
course, "noble," and are looking forward to ruling their
own castles. Noble, too, is Sire Eustace, the seneschal,
the baron's old companion in arms, who carries the
great gonfalon of St. Aliquis into battle, and who, in
peace times, is chief factotum and superintendent of
almost everything about the fief. The marshal who has
charge of the stables is also "the son of a good house,"
and the chamberlain, who has oversight over all that
interior economy which does not pertain to food, drink,
and mealtimes, is an elderly, childless knight who
became lamed in the service of the baron's father, and
who really holds an honorable sinecure. There are,
besides these, four other petty nobles, whose estates are
so small that they find it pleasantest to live at St. Aliquis,
ride in the baron's hunts, and command his men at
arms.</p>

<p>The remainder of the castle servants are indeed non-noble;
but there is nothing dishonorable in personal
service, provided you serve a lord higher than yourself.
Conon would feel complimented if, on a visit to Paris,
he were asked to carry a great pasty and set it before the
queen. The importance of a baron is somewhat gauged
by the number of his squires and noble servitors. Many
a poor sire has to put up with only one squire, and perhaps
a seneschal. As for Conon and Adela, they have
a cherished ambition that in their sons' day, at least, the
St. Aliquis butler, cellarer, dispenser, and even the
master falconer should be of gentle blood also; but that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>would be putting their household practically on an
equality with the duke's.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dinner, Supper and Nightfall</div>

<p>When dinnertime comes there will be a great rush for
the hall, but the ceremonies of the table will be told
later.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Of course, on common days one will not expect
a banquet&mdash;only one or two plates of meat, some fish, a
few vegetables, bread, and common wine, but all in
abundance. Hunger seldom troubles St. Aliquis. If the
weather is fine, very likely dinner and supper will be
served in the garden, outside the barbican, under
pleasant shade trees, close to the purling Rapide. There
will be long tables covered with linen dyed with Montpellier
scarlet. The honored guests will have cushioned
benches; the remainder will sit on almost anything.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Supper may be either in the hall or in the garden, according
to circumstances. It is a long time between
dinner and supper, and appetites are again keen. After
supper, if by the presence of jongleurs there are excuses
for torches and music, the castle folk join in diversions
or even in dancing, until a large silver cup is solemnly
handed to the baron. He drinks deeply. All his guests
are similarly served. Then he rises and the company
goes to bed. If there are honored visitors, Conon will
escort them to their chambers himself, and take another
sup of wine with them ere parting for the night.</p>

<p class="mb2">The seneschal meantime makes a careful round of the
walls, to satisfy himself that the outer drawbridge is
raised, the sentries posted, and that everything is safe.
Then he will transmit the ponderous keys to be taken to
the baron's room till dawn. The seigneur is undressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
by his squires and reposes under an avalanche of feather
beds thick enough to provide a vapor bath. Soon all
the lights are extinguished throughout the whole black
mass of the castle, save only the tall taper in the master's
apartment. So the castle sleeps through the darkness,
unbroken save for the occasional "All is well!" from the
yawning sentry on the turret, until the thrushes and
blackbirds begin their noise in the garden and in the
trees by the rivers. Then again St. Aliquis resumes its
daytime business.</p>

<h2>Chapter IV: Games and Diversions. Falconry
and Hunting. The Baroness' Garden.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_068.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">I</span>f Baron Conon has been fortunate enough
to receive a noble guest, almost the first
question is how to divert the stranger.
The inevitable program will be to constrain
the visitor to tarry at least long
enough to cast hawks or to chase down
a deer. If that is not possible, at least he will be courteously
urged to attempt some game, and it will be most
"ungentle" of him to refuse.</p>

<p>Indoor games are in great demand where bad weather
often makes open sports impossible and where bookish
diversions are limited. The baron frequently plays with
his own family when there are no outside guests, and all
the household are more or less expert. To understand
them is part of a gentle education for both sexes. Indeed,
there is no better way for a noble dame and a cavalier to
begin a romance than to sit through a long afternoon
studying one another's faces no less than the gaming
table.</p>

<p>Some of these diversions are decidedly like those of a
later age. For example, if all present are reasonably
literate they can play "ragman's roll"! Burlesque
verses&mdash;some suitable for men, some for women, and
all often deplorably coarse&mdash;are written on slips of
parchment wound in a roll. On each slip is a string with
some sign showing for which sex it is intended. Everybody
has to draw a roll, then open and read it aloud to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
the mirthful company. The verses are supposed to show
the character of the person drawing the same. Also,
even grown-up folk are not above "run around" games
which are later reserved for children. High barons
play blind-man's buff; seigneurs and dames sometimes
join in the undignified "hot cockles." A blindfolded
player kneels with his face on the knee of another and
with his hands held out behind him. Other players in
turn strike him on the hand, and he tries to guess who
has hit him. If he is correct, the person last striking
takes his place. Of course, a large part of the sport is to
deliver very shrewd blows. The fact that such a game
can be in vogue shows again that even the high and
mighty are often like hot-blooded children abounding in
animal spirits.</p>

<p>These games Conon will not press upon his guests.
He will urge on them backgammon, checkers, chess or, if
they seem young and secular, perhaps dice. Backgammon
is called "tables." It is a combination of dice
playing plus the motion of pieces on a board which goes
back to Roman times. The boards and methods of play
are so like those of a later age that one need not comment
thereon.</p>

<p>Backgammon is a popular diversion, but hardly more
so than checkers (Anglice "draughts") known in France as
"dames." Here also is a game that hardly changes essentially
from age to age. The checkermen at St. Aliquis are
square, not round. Otherwise, no explanation is needed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Backgammon, Checkers and Dice</div>

<p>What men like Conon really enjoy, however, are games
of dice. Nevertheless, since the Church has often censured
these cubes of ivory, he and his baroness do not
dare to use them too often; besides, they realize the
havoc often wrought among the young by dice throwing,
and wish to keep their own sons from temptation. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
parts of France there are laws reading: "Dice shall not
be made in this dominion, and those using them shall
be looked upon as suspicious characters."<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> All such enactments
are usually dead letters, and a high justiciar
can ordinarily punish merely the manufacture and use
of loaded dice. Although church prelates rail vigorously,
their complaints are not merely that games of chance
are, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ipso facto</i>, sinful, but that the blasphemies constantly
uttered by losing dice players form a means of
populating hell.</p>

<p>Dice playing assuredly is extremely common. It is
even impiously called "the game of God," because the
regulation of chance belongs to Providence. Did not the
Holy Apostles cast lots between Justus and Matthias to
select a successor to the wicked Judas; and can good
Christians question means acceptable to St. John and
St. Peter? So gamesters will quiet their consciences.
Vainly does King Philip Augustus command that any
person swearing over dice in his royal presence, no matter
how high his rank, shall be cast into the river. Dice are
everywhere&mdash;in the travelers' and pilgrims' wallets and
in almost every castle, hut, or town dwelling. Let any
three or four men come together for an idle hour and
fortunate it is if a set of dice does not appear to while
away the time. The thirteenth century is innocent of
cards; dice form the substitute.</p>

<p>The swearing is evil, but the gambling is worse. There
are at least ten gambling games, some with three dice,
some needing six. Adela has been warning Fran√ßois,
her eldest son, concerning a recent instance of reckless
playing. A young squire, whose father held lands of
Conon, set forth to seek his fortune at the king's court.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
He halted at Pontdebois, where he met an older soldier
of fortune at the tavern. The poor young man was
induced "to try a few casts." Soon he had lost his travel
money; next his horse; next his armor. In desperation
he began pledging his ordinary vesture to the tavern
keeper (who acted as a kind of pawnbroker). Ill luck still
pursued, and he was reduced to his bare shirt<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> before a
friend of his father's, chancing about the inn, recovered
his necessary clothes between them and sent him home,
utterly humiliated. Such calamities are constant. Dice
are daily the ruin of countless nobles and villeins&mdash;but
the accursed gaming continues. It is even rumored that
in certain disorderly monasteries these tools of the devil
often intrude further to demoralize the brethren.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_071"></a>
  <img src="images/i_071.jpg" width="400" height="384" alt="THE GAME OF CHESS" />

</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Chess in Great Esteem</div>

<p>No such ill odor,
however, attends that
game in which Conon
delights most. To
play at chess is part
of an aristocratic education.
In a jongleur's
romance we hear of a
young prince who was
brought up "first to
know his letters," and
then "to play at tables
(backgammon), and at
chess; and soon he
learned these games
so well that no man in this world could 'mate' him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Fran√ßois and Anseau, the baron's sons, make no such
boasts, but both know the moves, and Fran√ßois takes great
pride in having lately forced a visiting knight to a stalemate.
Great seigneurs and kings carry chessboards
around with them on campaigns and are said to amuse
themselves with chess problems immediately before or
after desperate battles. Plenty of other anecdotes tell of
short-tempered nobles who lost self-control when checkmated,
broke the chessboards over their opponents'
heads, and ended the contest in a regular brawl.</p>

<p>This royal game has doubtless come from the Orient.
Caliphs of the Infidels have long since boasted their
skill in taking rooks and pawns, but in western lands
about the first record comes from the time of Pope
Alexander II (1061-73), to whom complaint was made
that a bishop of Florence was "spending his evenings in
the vanity of chess playing." The bishop's enemies
alleged that this was forbidden by the canons prohibiting
dice. But the bishop retorted that "dice and chess were
entirely different things: the first sinful; the second a
most honorable exercise for Christians." The Pope
tactfully refrained from pressing the matter. Nevertheless,
austere churchmen regarded the game as worldly,
and impetuous religious reformers insisted on confounding
it with games of chance. It was only in 1212 that a
Council of Paris forbade French clerics to play chess,
just as it (for about the thousandth time) forbade
dice&mdash;despite which fact the Bishop of Pontdebois
spent a whole afternoon over the chessboard the last
time he visited the castle and could test his skill on
the baron.</p>

<p>As for the nobility, no one thinks of refusing to play,
although naturally it is the older knights who have the
patience for long contests. According to the <cite>Song of</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
<cite>Roland</cite>, after Charlemagne's host had taken Cordova
the Emperor and all his knights rested themselves in
a shady garden. The more sedate leaders immediately
played chess, although the younger champions selected
the more exciting backgammon.</p>

<p>The chessmen are often made of whalebone and imported
from Scandinavia. They are models of warriors.
The kings have their swords drawn; the knights are on
horseback; in place of castles we have "warders," a
kind of infantrymen; the bishops hold their croziers;
and the queens upbear drinking horns like the great
ladies in a northern house. Conon, however, has a
fine ivory set made in the East; and Oriental models
differ from the Norse. The Infidels, of course, have no
bishops; instead there is a <i>phil</i>&mdash;a carved elephant;
and since Moslems despise women, instead of a queen
there is a <i>phrez</i>, or counselor. Chessboards are usually
made of inlaid woods, or even metals, and Conon has an
elegant one with squares of silver and gilt, the gift of a
count whose life he once saved in battle.</p>

<p>Needless to say, chess is a game in which the women
can excel. Alienor is well able to defeat her brother,
despite his boasting; and among the duties of the
ladies of a castle is to teach the young squires who are
being "nourished" by its lord how to say "check."</p>

<p>Chess is supposed to be a game of such worth and
intricacy as not to need the stimulus of wagering. But,
alas! such is the old Adam in mankind that scandalous
gambling often goes on around a chessboard. At
festivals when nobles assemble, if two distinguished
players match their skill, there is soon an excited, if
decently silent, crowd around their table. Soon one
spectator after another in whispers places wagers to
support a contestant; the players themselves begin to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
bet on their own skill. The final result may leave them
almost as poverty-stricken as the dicers in the tavern,
as well as compromising salvation by awful oaths.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_074"></a>
  <img src="images/i_074.jpg" width="400" height="219" alt="A GAME OF BALL (STRUTT)" />
  <span class="caption">A GAME OF BALL (STRUTT)</span>
</div>

<p>Young nobles also kill much time with out-of-door
games resembling tennis and billiards. The tennis is
played without rackets,
by merely striking
the ball with the open
hand. The billiards
require no tables, but
are played on level
ground with wooden
balls struck with
hooked sticks or mallets, somewhat resembling the
hockey of another age. Here again reckless youths
often wager and lose great sums. Lads and young
maidens are fond, too, of guilles&mdash;a game resembling
ninepins, although the pins are knocked down, not with
balls, but with a stick thrown somewhat like a boomerang.
Of course, they also enjoy tossing balls, and young
ladies no less than their brothers practice often with the
arbalist, shooting arrows with large heads for bringing
down birds which take refuge in bushes when pursued
by the hawks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hawking</div>

<p>But chess, dice and every other game indoors or outdoors
pales before the pleasure of hawking or hunting.
There is no peace-time sensation like the joy of feeling a
fast horse whisk you over the verdant country, leaping
fences, and crashing through thickets with some desperate
quarry ahead. It is even a kind of substitute for the
delights of war. If a visiting knight shows the least
willingness, the baron will certainly urge him to tarry
for a hunting party. It will then depend on the season,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
the desire of the guests, and reports from the kennels
and mews and the forest whether the chase will be with
hawks or with hounds.</p>

<p>Master huntsmen and falconers are always at swords'
points. Their noble employers also lose their tempers
in the arguments as to venery and
falconry, but the truth is that both
sports are carried on simultaneously
at every castle. If fresh meat
is needed, if most of the riders are
men, if time is abundant, probably
the order is "bring out the dogs."
If only the sport is wanted, and
the ladies can ride out merely for
an afternoon, the call is for the
hawks.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">LADY WITH A FALCON ON HER WRIST</p>
<p class="center">From a thirteenth-century
seal (Archives nationales).</p></div>
</div>

<p>Hunting hawks are everywhere.
Last Sunday Adela and Alienor rode
over to mass at the abbey church.
The good brethren chanting the
service were nowise disturbed when
each of their high-born worshipers
kept a great hooded hawk strapped to her wrist during
the whole service.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> It is well to take your hawks everywhere
with you, especially when there are crowds of
people, to accustom them to bustle and shouting; but
we suspect another reason for always taking hawks about
is that the carrying of a hunting bird on your wrist is
a recognized method of saying, "I am of gentle blood
and need not do any disagreeable work with my hands."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Complicated Art of Falconry</div>

<p>Falcons are counted "noble birds"; they rank higher
in the social hierarchy of beasts than even eagles. If
one cannot afford large hawks and falcons one can at
least keep sparrow hawks; and "sparrow hawk" is the
nickname for poor sires who only maintain birds large
enough to kill partridges and quails. In short, the possession
of a hawk of <em>some</em> kind is almost as necessary
for a nobleman as wearing a sword, even with knights
who can seldom go out hunting. However, it takes a
rich noble like Conon to possess a regular falconry with
special birds, each trained for attacking a certain kind of
game&mdash;hares, kites, herons&mdash;with the expert attendants
to care for them.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_076"></a>
  <img src="images/i_076.jpg" width="400" height="517" alt="THE FALCON HUNT" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">THE FALCON HUNT</p>
<p class="center">Thirteenth century; from a German
manuscript in the Biblioth√®que
de Bruxelles.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Falconry has become a
complicated art. Very
possibly the good folk in
St. Aliquis will have their
bodies physicked or bled
by physicians much less
skillful in treating human
ills than Conon's falconers
are in treating birds. To
climb high trees or crags
and steal the young hawk
out of the nest is itself
no trifling undertaking.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
Then the prizes must be
raised to maturity, taught
to obey whistles and calls,
and to learn instantly to do
the bidding of the master. In the baron's mews are more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>than a score of birds; gerfalcons, saker hawks, lanners, merlins,
and little sparrow hawks squawk, peck, and squabble
along with <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'hugh'">huge</ins> goshawks. The male birds are generally
smaller than the female, and the latter are reserved for
striking the swiftest game, such as herons. Some birds
will return of their own accord to the hand of the master
after taking game, but many, including all sparrow
hawks, have to be enticed back by means of a lure of
red cloth shaped like a bird. The falconer swings his
lure by a string, and whistles, and, since the falcon is
accustomed to find a bit of meat attached to the lure,
he will fly down promptly and thus be secured.</p>

<p>Conon's head falconer is only a villein, but he is such
an expert that recently the Count of Champagne offered
a hundred Paris livres for him. This important personage
is himself the son of a falconer, for the science
runs in families. He is a man of shrewd knowledge and
a real wizard at breaking in young birds, teaching them
to strike dummies and decoys, to remain contented in
their cages or hooded on their perches, and yet not lose
their hunting spirit. He has precise methods of feeding&mdash;so
much meat, preferably poultry, and so much of vegetables,
preferably fresh fruit. He takes long counsel with
Conon how a recalcitrant goshawk can be induced to
sit quietly on the baron's fist. He also teaches young
Fran√ßois to carry his little sparrow hawk so it will not be
incommoded by any horse motion or be beaten upon
unpleasantly by the wind, and how to adjust its hood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Professional Jargon of Falconry</div>

<p>There are few more acceptable presents to a nobleman
or, better still, to a lady, than a really fine bird. Abbots
send five or six superior hawks to the king when craving
protection for their monasteries. Foreign ambassadors
present His Royal Grace with a pair of birds as the
opening wedge to negotiations. The "reception of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
hawks" is indeed a regular ceremony at the Paris court.
Most of Conon's hawks have come from fellow cavaliers
who craved his favor. The St. Aliquis gentry pride
themselves on understanding all
the professional jargon of falconry.
Only peasant clowns
would confess themselves ignorant
thereof; yet even among
nobles few speak it really well.
The other day a pretentious
knight dined at the castle. He
put his gerfalcon on the perch
provided in the hall for such use
by the guests. But, thunder of
heaven! how great seemed his
foolishness when Conon courteously
led the subject around to
falconry! "He said: 'The <em>hand</em>
of the bird' instead of 'the talon';
'the <em>talon</em>' instead of 'the claw';
'the <em>claw</em>' instead of 'the nail.'
It was most distressing to find
such a man with a claim to
courteous treatment!"</p>

<p class="center">Thirteenth century; restored by Viollet-Le-Duc, from a manuscript
in the Biblioth√®que de Bruxelles.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Of course, at some excesses in falconry Conon draws
the line. He considers impious his neighbor the Viscount
of Foretvert, who sprinkles his hawks with holy water
prior to every hunt, and says a prayer over them adjuring,
"You, O Eagles, by the True God, the Holy Virgin, and
the holy prophets, to leave the field clear for our birds
and not to molest them in their flight." The church
has never authorized this, though the viscount's worldly
chaplain certainly condones the practice.</p>

<p>Everything about falcons must be compatible with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
their nobility. The glove on which they are carried is
embroidered with gold. The hood which keeps them
blindfolded is likewise adorned with gold thread, pearls,
and bright feathers. Every bird has attached to his legs
two little bells engraved with his owner's name. High
in the air they can be heard tinkling. If the bird is lost
the peasants discovering it can return it to the owner&mdash;and
woe to the villein who retains a falcon found in the
forest! The local law provides that either he must pay
a ruinous fine or let the falcon eat six ounces of flesh
from his breast. As for stealing a hunting bird outright,
there is hardly a speedier road to the gallows; it is what
horse stealing some day will become in communities
very far from France.</p>

<p>Assuredly it is an exhilarating sight to see the castle
folk go hawking on a fine morning. The baron, baroness,
and all their older relatives and guests, each with bird
on gauntlet, are on tall horses; the squires and younger
people have sparrow hawks to send against the smaller
prey, but the leaders of the sport will wait until they
can strike a swift duck or heron. Dogs will race along
to flush the game. Horns are blowing, young voices
laughing, all the horses prancing. Conon gives the word.
Away they go&mdash;racing over fences, field and fallow,
thicket and brook, until fate sends to view a heron.
Then all the hawks are unhooded together; there are
shouts, encouragement, merry wagers, and helloing
as the birds soar in the chase. The heron may meet
his fate far in the blue above. Then follow more racing
and scurrying to recover the hawks. So onward, covering
many miles of country, until, with blood tingling,
all canter back to St. Aliquis in a determined mood for
supper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hunting Serious Business</div>

<p>Hunting is more serious business than falconry. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>castle folk do not care much for beef and mutton; they
prefer venison and boar's meat, and the great woods
to the east of the castle supply food no less than diversion.
Hunting is a pursuit
quite allowable to
pious laymen, and in
moderation is even
commended by the
Church. By hunting
one benefits one's
soul, for thus we
"avoid the sin of indolence,
and, according
to our faith, he
who avoids the seven
mortal sins will be
saved; therefore, the
good sportsmen will
be saved." The huntsmen's saints&mdash;St. Germain, St.
Martin, and above all St. Hubert of Li√®ge, a renowned
hunter of the eighth century<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>&mdash;are invoked in countless
castles oftener, one fears, than such greater saints as
St. Peter and St. Paul.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_080"></a>
  <img src="images/i_080.jpg" width="400" height="364" alt="A HUNTER" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A HUNTER</p>
<p class="center">From a seal of the thirteenth century<br />
(Archives nationales).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>There are many dangerous beasts in the great forests
spread over France. Charlemagne (the tale runs) was
once nearly hugged to death by a hard-pressed bear.
Every nobleman has met with very ugly boars and also
powerful stags who fought desperately.</p>

<p>As for the ladies (who, after all, are of one blood with
their brothers) the hunt is almost the closest they can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>come to martial pleasures. Adela and her sister-in-law
can wind horns, follow stags, control dogs almost as well
as Conon and Aimery. Of course, they could ride
from early girlhood. On occasion of ceremony they
ride sidesaddle, but when hunting and hawking they
go astride in wholly masculine manner. Fran√ßois has
been riding now for years, and even little Anseau,
barely seven, can cling to the back of a high steed and
keep beside his mother, unless the hunt becomes extremely
furious.</p>

<p>The equipments for hunting are simple. The only
real luxury is in the hunting horns, the great olifants
whose piercing notes can ring a mile through the still
forests. These horns are made of ivory, chased with
gold, and swung from each important rider's neck by a
cord of silk or fine leather. The hunters wear leather
gauntlets and use a bow and arrows, a "Danish ax"
(a kind of tomahawk), a boar spear (the favorite hunting
weapon), and also a large knife for emergencies. As
the party mounts in the castle court, around them are
leaping and yelping the great pack of dogs&mdash;white in
teeth, red tongues, straining the leashes and barely
controlled by their keepers. Dogs are loved almost as
much as falcons, and Conon has a large collection of greyhounds,
staghounds, boarhounds, and even of terrible
bloodhounds. The kennels are replenished constantly, for
stags and old boars can kill many dogs ere they are finally
run down and speared. The gift of a litter of fine puppies
is, therefore, often as welcome as a cast of hawks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chasing Down a Great Boar</div>

<p>It is a happy day if a beater comes in with tidings of
"a wild boar, the strongest of which anyone has ever
heard tell, in the forest of Pevele and Vicogne near the
free holdings of St. Bertin." The baron will call out all
the castle folk, and, if time admits, will send to some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>favorite vassals a few miles away to join the sport. With
ten pairs of hounds and at least fifteen huntsmen and
beaters he will thus organize the pursuit. The hunt
will start at dawn, and it will take much of the forenoon
to reach the forest where the boar has been discovered.
Then (recites a jongleur) will begin "the baying and
the yelping of dogs. They are unleashed. They bound
through the thicket and find the tracks where the boar
has dug and rooted for worms." One of the keepers
then unleashes Blanchart, the baron's best bloodhound.
Conon pats his head and they put him on the track.</p>

<p>The hound soon discovers the boar's lair. "It is a
narrow place between the trunks of two uprooted oaks,
near a spring. When the boar hears the baying of the
hound he stands erect, spreads his enormous feet, and,
disdaining flight, wheels around, until, judging himself
within reaching distance of the good hound, he seizes it
and fells it dead by his side. The baron would not have
given Blanchart for one hundred deniers. Not hearing
his barking he runs up, sword in hand; but he is too
late; the boar is gone."</p>

<p>After that there is nothing for it except to keep up
the chase relentlessly until evening, with the whole
company gradually scattering through the forest until
Conon at last overtakes the chase. But the baron is
now alone save for a few dogs. "The boar has finally
come to bay in front of a thicket. He begins by refreshing
himself in a pool; then, raising his brows, rolling his
eyes, and snorting, he bares his tusks and dashes upon
the dogs, and rips them open or tears them to pieces,
one after another, all except three of the best greyhounds.
Then Conon arrives, and first of all he sees
his dogs stretched out dead. 'Oh, son of a sow,' cries
he, 'it is you that have disemboweled my dogs, have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>separated me from my friends, and have brought me
I know not where! You shall die!' He leaps from his
steed. At his shout the boar, despite bushes and ditches,
leaps upon him swift as an arrow. Conon lets him come
straight on, and, holding the boar spear straight before
him, strikes at his breast. The point pierces the heart
and goes out at the shoulder blade. Mortally wounded,
the boar swerves to one side, totters, and falls."<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> So the
chase ends and the dogs are avenged. The baron has
to blow his horn many times ere his party finds him.
Luckily the boar has run back somewhat toward St.
Aliquis. They are therefore able to get home in noisy
triumph that night, and all the castle women are under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
the red torches outside the gate to "oh!" and "ah!" at
the boar and to praise the prowess of their seigneur.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_083"></a>
  <img src="images/i_083.jpg" width="400" height="409" alt="THE STAG HUNT" />
  <div class="caption">LIFE IN THE MIDDLE AGES
<p class="center">THE STAG HUNT</p>
<p class="center">Twelfth century; from a window in the cathedral of Chartres.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="mt2">Conon is fortunate in being able to return home
without more adventures. His high suzerain, King
Philip Augustus, while a young prince, once followed a
boar until he was lost in the forest, and became justly
anxious; but just as he was commending himself to
God, the Virgin, and "St. Denis, the protector of the
King of France," to his great relief he met "a charcoal
burner, grim to behold, with a face black with charcoal,
carrying a great ax on his shoulder." This honest
peasant guided the prince to safety.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hunting Across Peasants' Lands</div>

<p>One important part of the St. Aliquis population,
however, regards all hunting parties with far less satisfaction.
The chase often goes straight across the
peasants' fields, with twenty horses beating down the
newly seeded ground or even the standing crops. This
is the baron's absolute privilege and any protest is
treasonable. The villeins have not simply to submit
to this, but if deer nibble or boars root upon their fields,
they can merely try to scare the ravagers off. Their
lord and his friends alone may use arrow, blade, or spear
against the game. The St. Aliquis peasants bless the
saints that this time the boar kept conveniently in the
forest and did not sell his life dearly in a half-ripe cornfield.</p>

<p>Hawking and hunting are two great out-of-door sports,
always excepting martial exercises and downright war;
although sometimes Aimery and other young men, for
a tame diversion, take crossbows and try to shoot birds
in the meadows.</p>

<p class="mt2">If Conon is naturally the master of the hunt, Adela
is as invariably mistress of a very important place&mdash;the
garden. Castles are disagreeable residences. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
with the newer <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">palais</i> rising beside the grim donjon, they
are usually dampish, illy lighted, and subject to uncanny
odors. In northern France there is enough confining
weather in any case. Therefore, the more reason there
is, the moment the sun shines, for hastening where there
are sweet air, bright flowers, and delightful greenness.</p>

<p>The castle garden is outside the barbican, shut off
by a dense hedge from the exercise ground. In it are
not merely many beds of flowers, but fruit trees and a
group of venerable elms much older than the First
Crusade. Also, there is a broad, fine stretch of closely
cropped grass, shaded by the trees for most of the day.
Here all kinds of things can occur. At long tables the
whole castle will dine and sup in fine weather. Here
Conon will assemble his vassals for ceremonious council.
Here will be played innumerable games of chess. And
here especially, if a few jongleurs can be found to saw
their viols on f√™te days, all the castle folk, noble and
villein, will rapturously join in dances, not in stuffy
hall under midnight lamps, but in bright daylight with
the merry feet twinkling on God's soft green grass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Castle Garden</div>

<p>Adela has taken great pains with her garden, which
fell into a bad condition during Baron Garnier's day.
She often councils with Brother Sebastian at the abbey,
a real botanist with a true love of plants and flowers.
One side of the beds is adorned with roses, lilies, and
marigolds. On the other grow useful herbs such as
lettuce, cresses, mint, parsley, hyssop, sage, coriander,
and fennel. With these, too, are also poppies, daffodils,
and acanthus plants, while a vegetable garden supplies
the castle with cucumbers, beets, mustard, and wormwood.
The fruit trees yield a sizable crop of apples,
quinces, peaches, and pears. There is a kind of hot-house
in which the baroness has tried to raise figs, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
with no great success; but, of course, there is no difficulty
in maturing grapes and cherries; indeed, cherry festivals
are among the most familiar and delightful holidays in
all this part of France. "Life," say monkish writers,
warning the thoughtless, "though perhaps pleasant, is
transitory, 'even as is a cherry fair.'"</p>

<p>"Crooked" Heman (the hunchbacked gardener) has
considerable skill even without the teachings of Brother
Sebastian. He practices grafting successfully, although
his theories on the subject are absurd. He is trying to
develop a new kind of plum and is tenderly raising some
of the new "Agony" pears&mdash;a bitter variety for pickling.
True, he believes that cherries can grow without stones
if you have the right recipe, and that peach trees will
bear pomegranates if only you can sprinkle them with
enough goats' milk. This does not prevent large practical
results. His tools are simple&mdash;an ax, a spade, a
grafting knife, and a pruning hook; but, thanks to the
unlimited number of peasant clowns which the baroness
can put at his disposal, he keeps the garden and orchard
in admirable order.</p>

<p class="mb2">Heman's office is the more important because the
garden does not exist solely as a pleasure spot or for its
fruits and vegetables. Flowers are in constant demand,
whenever obtainable, for garlands and chaplets. Even
as with the Greeks, no feast is complete without them.
Wild flowers are in favor, and many a time Adela's
maids are sent out to gather and wreathe woodbine or
hawthorn; but, of course, such a supply is irregular.
On every social occasion from early spring to the edge of
winter the castle garden must, therefore, supply its garlands.
It is, accordingly, one of the essential working
units of St. Aliquis, along with the stables, the mews,
and the armory.</p>

<h2>Chapter V: The Family of the Baron. Life
of the Women.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_087.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">C</span>onon, we have said, has lived in great
harmony with his baroness. Well he
might. A short time ago a visiting
cavalier, who had learned to string words
after the South Country troubadour
fashion, saw fit to praise Adela after
this manner: "She has fair blond locks and a forehead
whiter than the lilies. Her laughing eyes change color
with her mood. Her nose is straight and firm. Her
fresh face outvies the white and vermilion of the flowers.
Her mouth is small and her teeth are white like snow
on the wild rose. White are her fair hands, and the
fingers are both smooth and slender." Also the baron
is very proud of his sister, for whom he is planning a
worthy marriage. A Breton jongleur, who found St.
Aliquis's hospitality grateful, sang thus of Alienor:
"Passing slim is the lady, sweet of bodice and slender of
girdle. Her throat is whiter than snow on branch, and
her eyes are like flowers set in the healthful pallor of her
face. She has a witching mouth, a dainty nose, and an
open brow. Her eyebrows are brown, and her golden
hair is parted in two soft waves upon her forehead."<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Types of Beautiful Women</div>

<p>Both of these laudators exaggerate. Neither Adela
nor Alienor has a monopoly of good looks; yet a life of
eager exercise in the open has given them both a complexion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>which many a town-pent rival might envy.
Their positions in the castle, as at once the gracious
hostesses to equals and the unquestioned mistresses
over hundreds of dependents, bestow on them dignity
and "noble" assurance. Each lady rejoices in the good
fortune of being blond, a first prerequisite to beauty&mdash;for
in all the romances there is hardly one brunette
maiden who comes in for praise. Their
hair falls down the length of their arms,
to the owners' great satisfaction, and is
worn in two long braids, entwined with
ribbons, or on gala days with gold thread,
resting in front over their shoulders.
Adela, at least, has long since become
complaisant to all kinds of flatteries,
though Alienor is still thrilled when a
jongleur or sentimental knight assures
her that she has "lips small as an infant's,"
"cheeks the color of peach
bloom," "teeth of perfect regularity,"
"breath sweet as the censer swung above
a church altar," and that "her beauty
suddenly illuminates the whole castle."
Both of the ladies are tall and slender,
again the ideal type of femininity; and
they have unconcealed pity for the poor
Viscountess of Foretvert, who is short,
plump, and afflicted with dark hair.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 135px;"><a id="i_088"></a>
  <img src="images/i_088.jpg" width="135" height="400" alt="COIFFURE OF A NOBLEWOMAN" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">COIFFURE OF A NOBLEWOMAN</p>
<p class="center">Twelfth century<br />
(cathedral of Chartres).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Alienor's mother is dead, but her sister-in-law is
enough older to take her place somewhat and give
much well-meant advice, which the younger damsel
must take meekly. Adela often admonishes thus: "My
fair sister, be courteous and meek, for nothing else so
secures the favor of God and of mortals. Be friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
to small and great. I have seen a great duchess bow
ceremoniously to an ironmonger. One of her followers
was astonished. 'I prefer' replied she, 'to have been
guilty of too great courtesy toward that man, than
guilty of the least incivility toward a knight.' Also one
must shun foreign fashions at festivals and tourneys,
lest one become foolishly conspicuous; and above all
beware of lofty headgear, lest you resemble stags who
must lower their heads on entering a wood, and in order
that you may not by your loud fashions make everyone
stare at you as if you were a wild beast."</p>

<p>Recently, too, Adela has been giving sisterly advice
on how to walk becomingly: "Look straight before you,
with your eyelids low and fixed, gazing forward at the
ground six fathoms ahead, not changing your look from
one place to another, nor laughing, nor stopping to
chatter with anybody upon the highway."</p>

<p>Conon, too, has beset poor Alienor, with all the superiority
of an elder brother. He has commended the instructions
of a certain <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">trouv√®re</i> (North French minstrel) to a
young noblewoman. She must not talk too much; especially
she must not boast of the attentions paid by young
knights. When going to church she must not "trot or run,"
but salute "debonairely" all persons she meets. She must
not let men caress her with their hands or kiss her upon the
mouth. They might misconstrue such familiarities. She
must not go around with part of her body uncovered,
undress in the presence of men, nor accept presents from
any man not a kinsman nor her accepted lover.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Good Manners for Noblewomen</div>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">trouv√®re</i> instructor also goes on to warn his fair
pupils against scolding in public, against overeating,
and against getting drunk, "whence much mischief might
arise." Unless she is ugly or deformed, she should not
cover her face coquettishly. "A lady who is pale faced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>or has not a good smell ought to breakfast early in the
morning! for good wine gives a very good color, and
she who eats and drinks well can heighten her complexion."
To avoid bad breath eat aniseed and fennel
for breakfast. Keep your hands clean and cut your nails
so as not to retain dirt. When you are sharing the same
dish at table with some one else (as is the custom) do not
pick out all the best bits for yourself; and beware of
swallowing too large or too hot a morsel of food. Also,
wipe your mouth frequently, but on your napkin, and
particularly not upon the tablecloth. Also, do not
spill from your mouth or grease your hands too much.
Young ladies also should keep from telling lies.&mdash;Alienor
wishes the impertinent <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">trouv√®re</i> in purgatory.</p>

<p>But following Conon and Adela, Father Gr√©goire,
the chaplain, and then even holy Brother Matthew,
the prior of the abbey, takes her in hand. She must
avoid sin by never letting her mantle trail disgracefully,
lest she seem like a fox whose glory is in his tail. Her
maids must avoid repeating gossip. She must never
travel without proper retinue, lest she be caught in
compromising situations. She must attend mass regularly
and not be satisfied "merely with hearing low
mass and hurrying two or three times through the Lord's
Prayer and then going off to indulge herself with sweetmeats."
Alienor should also avoid all games of chance,
including backgammon (advice, indeed, at which Conon
laughs) and not to waste too much time even at chess,
nor to take indecent pleasure in the low songs and antics
of the jongleurs. No wonder the poor girl vows she
will <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'peversely'">perversely</ins> do these very things at first opportunity!<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>
<p>Alienor tells herself, however, that she is fortunate
she is not troubled by worse things than hortatory friends.
Champions of "equality of sexes" from a later age can
become horrified over the legal status of women in the
feudal centuries. Females can never bear arms; they
must remain perpetually as minors before the law.
Even a great heiress will be under severe pressure to
take a husband who will perform the military duties of
her fief as soon as possible. If a baron dies, leaving
only a young daughter, the suzerain can complain that
he has been injured in one of his most important rights&mdash;his
claim to armed service from the fief holder. Where
now is the vassal to follow his banner? Perhaps a
decent suzerain will wait until the heiress is twelve.
Then he will "give" her to some battleworthy follower.
She will not have any real choice, even if the bridegroom
is old, ugly, and brutal.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many a fatherless girl becomes
terribly anxious to be married. Only married women
have a fixed status in feudal society. Only a husband can
keep an heiress's lands from shameless plunder. There
is the familiar story of a young noblewoman who went
straight before the king and said: "My father has been
dead two months. I demand of you a husband." She
never dreamed of suggesting any particular husband.
<em>That</em> was the suzerain's business; but to leave her in
unprotected celibacy was an outrage which no lord
had a right to inflict upon an orphan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of Women in Castles</div>

<p>Legally and morally, husbands have the right to treat
their wives harshly if the latter provoke them. Every
girl around St. Aliquis knows the story of the silly wife
who often contradicted her husband in public, and how,
after he had vainly remonstrated, "one day raised his fist,
knocked her down, and kicked her in the face while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
she was prostrate, and so broke her nose." The story
conveys the plain lesson that she was directly to blame,
"for it is only right that words of authority should
belong to her lord, and the wife's duty requires that
she should listen in peace and obedience." It is, indeed,
repeated as something rather exceptional that Adela
has recently boasted to certain relatives: "My husband
since our marriage has never once laid hands on me."
Not that all castellans are brutal&mdash;but after all, men
will be men, lose their tempers, and treat their wives
accordingly. Everybody knows the scene from an epic
poem where a certain king is angered at a tactless
remark by his queen, and therefore "shows his anger in
his face, and strikes her in the nose so hard that he
draws four drops of blood, at which the lady meekly
says 'Many thanks. When it pleases you, you may do
it again!'" Such submissiveness is the best way to
disarm a husband's anger.</p>

<p>Conon has been mildly ridiculed among his fellow
knights because he takes counsel with his wife. Minstrels
like to make fun of such cavaliers and to commend
the baron who told his officious spouse: "Woman, go
within and eat and drink with your maids. Busy yourself
dyeing silks. Such is <em>your</em> business. <em>Mine</em> it is to
strike with the sword of steel!"<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Of course, many knights
do worse things than to tell their wives not to meddle,
and, if not obeyed, occasionally knock them down. It
has been told how Baron Garnier imprisoned his unhappy
consort. This was harsh, but not exceptional. Philip
Augustus, the reigning king, kept his unlucky bride,
Ingebord of Denmark, long years in captivity, notwithstanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>the menaces of the Church; holding her tight
in the gloomy Tower of √âstampes, where she complained
she had not enough either to eat or to wear.
Many nobles sometimes imitate their lord. Thus over
in Burgundy, Gautier of Salins recently threw his wife
into prison, whence, however, she contrived to escape
to her parents. In any case, when, for the sake of her
fiefs, a girl of twelve to eighteen is wedded to a husband
of forty or fifty, all kinds of unhappy things can happen.
The devil can fill the poor damsel's mind with love for a
handsome squire. Her lord may neglect her scandalously
until suddenly he finds himself required to avenge "his
honor" by some deed of startling cruelty. Such things
make the kind saints weep. Not without reason does
Conon make discreet inquiries concerning a certain
widower knight who has sought Alienor's hand: "Does
he horsewhip his servants save for good cause? Did he
leave his last wife to mope about the hall while he
spent his months riotously at the king's court?"</p>

<p>Nevertheless the chatelaines and baronesses of these
parts are not always meek doves at the mercy of their
husbands. Are they not sprung themselves from a
domineering stock? Are they not reared around a castle,
which is a great barrack, and where the talk is ever of
feuds and forays, horses, lances, and armor? Many a
noble lady can answer her husband's fist with a rousing
box on the ear, and, if he is not a courageous man, make
him quail and surrender before her passions. Her
habits are likely to seem very masculine. If she can
quarrel like a virago, she can also prove a she-wolf in
times of danger. A knight will ride away to the wars,
leaving his castle under the command of his wife and
feel certain that it will be defended to the inner donjon.
The rough men at arms will obey her orders as implicitly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
as her husband's. In short, the feudal noblewoman
is, as might be expected, a compound of mortal weaknesses
and excellencies, but all of these qualities are
somewhat na√Øve and elemental.</p>

<p>In any case the castle women cannot complain of
being shut up in a harem. They have perfect freedom
to meet strange men. If we accept the epic poems,
when noble maidens believe a visiting knight to be very
handsome they do not hesitate to tell him so to his face.
In many love stories the first advances come from the
lady, and not infrequently these advances are rather
coldly received by the knight. Your average mail-clad
cavalier is a man of strong passions, but he is often
more interested in war and the chase than in fair maidens.
He is seldom a philanderer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Grossness of Castle Life</div>

<p>If we visited the castles around St. Aliquis and listened
to typical jongleurs' tales, we should gather abundant
material for monkish preachments. Noble ladies are
said to make few difficulties about inviting male visitors
to their chambers to sit on their beds while they are
still within the same&mdash;or entering the room of a male
guest and sitting on <em>his</em> bed while conversing very
familiarly. Women often meet strangers in scandalously
insufficient garments. Ladies also talk with the uttermost
freedom to men, quite as openly as young men will
talk on ticklish matters among themselves. Many a
story, jesting question, or "gab" which is utterly coarse,
not to say worse, will be exchanged in mixed company.
Young women are seldom well chaperoned. In place of
the duenna there is the "waiting woman," herself apt to
have her own lover and ready to help her mistress push
matters with hers. If there is a sensual intrigue, all
criticism ceases if there is, at the end, a formal marriage;
but many romances (according to the current stories)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
in no wise end in marriages. A wedding is by no means
the standard climax even to a happy love affair.</p>

<p>The monks, of course, are scandalized at less harmful
things than these. They assert that the fair sex, besides
being sinful coquettes, are spendthrifts, ruining their
husbands by their own extravagance. Women as a sex
are inordinately fond of false hair, rouging, and other
forms of giving a lie to the faces which God has vouchsafed.
As for controlling them, Brother Guyot, of
Provins, wrote in despair thus: "The wisest are astray
when they wish to judge or correct a woman. She has
never found her master, and who can flatter himself that
he knows her? When her eyes weep her heart laughs.
There are men who teach astronomy, necromancy,
geometry, law, medicine, and music; but I have never
known a person who was not a fool to take <em>woman</em> for
a subject of study."</p>

<p>All the above seems true. Yet when due allowances
are made, the number of noblewomen who lead happy,
honorable lives is great; and if many barons are unkind
to their wives, many others reckon them as their greatest
treasures. If reasonable care has been taken not to
force the mating of obviously uncongenial couples, a
decent respect is likely to result, even after a marriage
arranged wholly by outsiders. If, in many of the epics,
sundry fair ladies seem unprudish, very many others
are superlatively faithful, devoted to their husbands,
foes to all evil thoughts and seducers, and know how to
draw the line very sharply between those familiar attentions
which courtesy demands and those where real
sinfulness begins. Even a baron who will curse his wife
roundly and switch her shoulders treats her also as his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">jur√©</i>,
the holder of his pledge, to whom he can trust his honor
and leave the command of his castle when he rides to war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Accomplishments of Castle Women</div>

<p>"A great deal depends upon the woman herself,"
Adela assures Alienor. Husbands and wives are shut
up together in a castle often for weary months, and a
clever wife can easily make herself indispensable to her
husband, and then rule the whole barony. In short, in
treatment of women, as in all things else, the Feudal
Age is a jumble of contradictions. You can find the
worst and the best. "A good woman suffices to illuminate
a kingdom," a poet declares; while even a crusty
monk writes that "we ought to love, serve, and honor
woman, for out of her we all come." And what, in one
sense, is the intense worship of the Virgin but a sign
that woman is extraordinarily venerated and very
powerful? "God, thou son of St. Mary"&mdash;is that not
a standing invocation among the knights?</p>

<p>As for the pursuits of the women, there is little about
the castle to which they cannot devote themselves.
Sometimes they have even to replace the men on armed
expeditions. Adela is grateful that she has not had to
imitate the great Countess Blanche of Champagne, who
(while guardian of her young son) has recently, in 1218,
conducted an invading army into Lorraine and burned
Nancy, and then again, near Ch√¢teau-Villein, has led
her knights in person and won a real pitched battle.
Adela, however, understands all the technic of defending
the castle in a siege, she can help her husband about
the entire peace-time economy of the seigneury, check
up the provosts's accounts, sift out the complaints of
the peasants, arrange the alms to the poor, and, best of
all, knows how to manage the local bishop and abbot,
with a mingling of piety, harmless coquetry, and firmness&mdash;a
great asset for the weal of the barony.</p>

<p>Her greatest task, however, is to direct the perpetual
weaving, knitting, embroidering, and sewing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
castle women. Even if some of the finer cloth is imported,
nearly all the garments must be made up in St. Aliquis;
and the ladies must set their maids as good an example
with their needles as the baron must furnish to his men
with his sword. The chambers of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">palais</i>, and even
the garden in summer, seem given over to incessant
cutting and sewing; and many a time can you watch
the fair Alienor, like the girl in the romance, "seated in
her brother's chambers, working a stole and 'amise' in
silk and gold, right skillfully; and she made it with care,
and many a little cross and many a little star she sets
therein, singing all the while the 'Song of the Cloth'"&mdash;a
gentle, lilting air suitable for the movements of her
white hands and her needle.</p>

<p>It was when so engaged that her brother, coming in
early from the hounds, vowed he would not spare the
dowry to get her a gallant husband; and that night
he cast five deniers to the jongleur who praised her to
her face before the applauding hall:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She is the rose, the lily, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweetest violet, and through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her noble beauty, stately mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think her now the finest queen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which mortal eyes have ever seen.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Simple, yet coy, her eyes flash joy:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">God give her life without annoy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every bliss whereof I ween!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">Customs at Births and Baptisms</div>

<p>Of course, the prime centers of Adela's life are the
rearing of her children and the management of her
servants. When little Fran√ßois and Anseau were being
born, the castle bell, and that, too, of the village church,
were all the time rung furiously to induce the saints to
ease their mother's labor. Sensible Father Gr√©goire had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
to interpose his ghostly authority to check the midwife
from at once plunging the feet of the newly born into icy
water to toughen them to the cold, or rubbing their
cheeks with a gold piece to make them rich. Of course,
Conon was delighted each time they told him, "A sturdy
son!" On Fran√ßois' advent he called all his vassals to
a feast. "Be joyous!" he proclaimed. "There is born
the seigneur from whom you will hold your lands. He
will give you rich furs, white and gray, beautiful arms,
and horses of price. Yes, in twenty years my son will
be dubbed a knight!"</p>

<p>The young St. Aliquis barons were rocked in beautifully
carved cradles. They were bathed before a great
fire and wrapped, not merely
in the usual long baby clothes,
but in little robes of silk and
furs, even of precious ermine,
to proclaim their noble rank.
They were, of course, baptized
at first opportunity, because
unbaptized children had very
dubious chances in the next
world. Adela had been unable
to go to the ceremony for either, but there had been a
great gathering of relatives and vassals; for a christening
is the formal acknowledgment of the child's legitimacy
and settles many claims to inheritance. A child must
have three godparents, two of its own sex and one of the
other. At the font, one of these holds the babe round
the body, and each of the others grasps a leg. Then
the priest dips the child completely in the water. "Bare
as a babe at baptism," runs the saying. Of course, the
higher the rank of the godparents, the luckier the infant.
Fran√ßois is proud already because the Duke of Quelqueparte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
calls him "godson," and Anseau because he is styled
the same by the high Countess of Blois.</p>

<p>Up to seven the young boys were left to the care of
their mother. Adela nursed her own sons, although
wet nurses were the rule in many noble families; but
at least three maids were constantly in attendance on
each young sprig of St. Aliquis. Neither Fran√ßois nor
Anseau is spared the wholesome diet of many blows.
Monkish preachers are always warning against sparing
the rod and spoiling the child, and every father and
mother heeds this particular admonition. Truth to
tell, conditions round a castle often tend to make boys
little demons of rascality. All the hall has laughed at
the epic "Daurel and Beton," in which a child at four
was clever enough to steal his guardian's gloves, and
at five to play chess and dice and to ride a tall horse.
But Fran√ßois and Anseau are growing up reasonably
honest, thanks to frequent dermal pain. They have
enjoyed a great variety of toys, most of them of types
as old as the Pyramids and which will be a delight in
succeeding centuries. There are dolls with hempen wigs,
carved wooden soldiers with helms and hauberks, windmills,
all kinds of animals made of baked clay, wooden
horses, and, of course, an armory of wooden weapons.
The scores of children swarming the bailey are at their
disposal as playfellows, with the sons of the higher
officers preferred. There are innumerable games of the
tag variety, but already Fran√ßois is learning to marshal
his playmates in military companies. What greater delight
than to defend some tower against their father's old
foe, Foretvert? It will be lucky if they do not filch real
arbalists and shoot deadly bolts at one another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Education of Young Noblewomen</div>

<p>Fran√ßois is now being taken in hand by his father and
taught many things needful for a baron's son to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
before he is sent away to be "nourished" by some friendly
seigneur. He has no sisters, but his aunt Alienor is just
emerging from the usual education of a girl of family.
If there had been a local nunnery she might have been
sent to the convent school. As it was, Conon took in
the daughter of a petty noble, a kind of sister under minor
vows, who was half teacher, half attendant.</p>

<p>This good soul has given Alienor rather more of bookish
learning than Fran√ßois will probably obtain. The
young lady has learned to read and write Romain (North
French) and at least to read Latin. The result is that
she devours every romance manuscript which she can
borrow or can persuade her brother to buy. She has
been taught arithmetic fairly well; she has learned the
names of the chief stars and constellations and the legend
about the "Way of St. Jacques" (the Milky Way).
She has picked up a knowledge of healing herbs and is
not afraid of the sight of blood, nor does she flinch when
binding up a wound. Warfare and tourneys require
that young girls should become expert nurses and even
make shift to set shattered bones. Of course, she can
ride, and at hawking or hunting upon her dear roan
Marchegai can keep up with the best; and, like every
fortunate maiden in France, her lips are perpetually
light with songs&mdash;pious or secular, from quaint little
chants in honor of the Virgin to the merry</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Easter time in April<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sings each small bird gentle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Zo fricand√©s, zo, zo!</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Zo fricand√©s, zo!</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Assuredly, Father Gr√©goire and the monks have not
neglected her religious education. She has learned
many prayers, besides the Credo, Ave, and Paternoster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
which every Christian child must memorize as soon as
possible. Her brother one Easter gave her a finely illustrated
psalter, and she has most of the chants by heart.
By constant attendance at mass she knows practically
the entire service and understands its symbolism. She
has plenty of quaint little superstitions, but no degrading
ones. At bedtime she repeats a prayer which is popular
with all the girls of France: "I implore thee again, Virgin
Mary, mayest thou, with all the saints and the elect of
God, keep close to me and council me, and further all
my prayers and desires: and be with me in all my
sorrows and necessities, in all that I am called upon to
do, to say, or to think; on all days, at all hours, through
all the moments of my life."</p>

<p>Her dolls, of course, have been much finer, and have
been retained much longer, than those of Fran√ßois. In
her chamber her pet falcon is seldom lacking from his
perch&mdash;a fact which does not add to cleanliness. She has
also a caged magpie which she is laboriously teaching to
talk. At the last fair she longed vainly for a rare Eastern
parrot, but has consoled herself with a very small lap
dog presented by a friendly vassal. Cats abound in the
bailey, but they are not pets for noblewomen. There is
something plebeian about them. Ill-famed old crones
always possess black cats, which possibly partake of the
devil. The Church, however, does not support this last
belief, because in most nunneries the sisters are forbidden
to keep any animals except cats, which evidently belong
less to this world than dogs, the companions of secular
warriors.</p>

<p>There is one thing which Alienor really loves even
better than riding and hawking&mdash;<em>a long, hard dance</em>.
The mania young people have for dancing is sinful.
The Church vainly tries to restrain it. Preferably,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Alienor would dance with a handsome knight or squire,
yet if these lack, the most indifferent music and company
will suffice. The truth is that her robust, vigorous body
demands a violent outlet. It is vain for the graver Adela
to tell her of the count who allowed so much dancing
in his castle that finally at a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bal</i> on Christmas Day so
many joined the revel and all danced so violently that
the floor of his great hall suddenly collapsed. The
whole company were flung to the cellar, and the foolish
count's own daughter was the first body to be taken out.</p>

<p>At the time of the great Church festivals, of course,
comes the delight of the mystery plays, and Alienor
herself has participated therein, once as an angel and
once also as Queen Esther at the Easter play arranged
at Pontdebois by the cathedral clergy. She has hopes
now that next Easter she can be Herodias's daughter&mdash;which
is surely the best part open to women, except
that of the Holy Virgin herself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Castle Servants</div>

<p>While Adela is, on her part, graciously assisting her
family, she is also more explicitly directing her servants.
She need not reckon the lack of domestic help among her
troubles; hundreds of young men and women from the
peasants are only too glad to enter service in return for
a straw pallet, a suit of clothes yearly, and a seat in the
great hall after the regular diners have risen. Money
wages need hardly be considered, although everybody
expects a few obols at Christmas and Easter. The
importance of a baron is partly indicated by the number
of his dependents wearing his insignia, "eating his
bread," and attending him and his lady everywhere.
Conon is hardly less vain than his peers. The result is
that St. Aliquis has twice as many servitors as are really
required. The courtyards swarm with busy idlers,
although there is a certain organization and hierarchy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
of service, and all but the least responsible lads and
damsels enjoy the honor of having at least <em>one</em> inferior
whom they can afflict with cuffings and snappish
orders.</p>

<p>Adela commands some twenty young women. One or
two of these are <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pucelles</i>, daughters of petty nobles and
entitled to a certain consideration, even as are the baron's
squires. They dress their mistress and Alienor, accompany
them, and discreetly share their pleasures. The
others, strong-limbed Aiglentine, Jeanette, Martine, and
their sisters, by their loose, sleeveless aprons betray
peasant origin. They have been carefully selected by
the baroness from thrice as many candidates. She has
taken pains to learn whether they come of honest parents,
are greedy or inclined to drink, are respectful, and
whether they are accustomed merely to answer on receiving
an order, "It shall be done pretty soon."<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Duties of Servants</div>

<p>These maids are trained to clean the apartments; next
to wipe down all the stools and benches; next to feed the
"chamber animals"&mdash;dogs and cage birds. After that
the mistress must assign to them their task of weaving,
cutting, sewing, etc. They are fed plentifully, "but
only on one meat, and have only one kind of drink,
nourishing but not heady, whether wine or otherwise."
They must also eat promptly, "not reposing on their
meal, or halting or leaning on their elbows," and "they
must rise as soon as they begin to talk and lounge about."
After supper they must go immediately to bed, unless with
the remainder of the castle they sit up for a jongleur.</p>

<p class="mb2">So passes the routine of many days until at last the
prospect dawns of an event which will tax the full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>administrative capacities of the baroness, and which
sets Adela and Aimery each in a different kind of a
flutter. Conon is about to give his sister in marriage
and immediately after that to knight his brother. There
will be a festival which will carry the name of St. Aliquis
all over northern France.</p>

<h2>Chapter VI: The Matter of Clothes. A Feudal
Wedding.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_105.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">I</span>nasmuch as from time immemorial a
wedding has seemed primarily a matter
of clothes, what better place than this
wherein to consider the costumes of the
good folk of St. Aliquis? Assuredly, the
Scripture warns us, "Take no thought
saying ... 'Wherewithal shall we be clothed?'" but
that admonition (so Adela tells the abbot) was doubtless
intended only for the Holy Apostles, not for a Christian
woman who must make a fair showing for her husband
in the face of Heaven knows how many critical baronesses
and countesses.</p>

<p>Already Western folk have made that great change
in their general style of costume which is to last for
many generations later. The Greeks and Romans
<em>wrapped on</em> their garments; all of them were forms
of slightly elaborated shawls, fastened with fibul√¶
or buckles, but devoid of buttons. Even as late
as Frankish times the garments of Charlemagne's
contemporaries seemed fairly loose, after the antique
model. But with the Feudal Age has come
elaborately made clothing which must be <em>put on</em>
and securely fastened. We have reached the epoch
of the shirt, the stocking, and even of objects later
to be styled "trousers." Perhaps the life constantly
spent in the saddle requires this; also, the demand
for garments easily worn under the hauberks, the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>coats of mail.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The great transition has been made.
The men of St. Aliquis wear garments strange enough
to another epoch, but without those sartorial differences
which will separate the twentieth century from
the age of Nero.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Materials for Clothing</div>

<p>Another thing to observe is that nearly all garments
are still made of wool, save, indeed, the leathern leggings
and gauntlets of the hunters, and crude garments of skins
for the peasants. Cotton and silk, if not quite unknown,
have been rare, with linen not very common. The
woolen fabrics have usually been coarse, home spun
literally, made up in the castles or farmhouses. Such
garments are warm and durable, but they are prone
to collect dirt, hard to wash, and very irritating to the
skin. Probably it is the general use of woolen clothing,
along with the fact that much of the population possesses
no other raiment than what it is wearing incessantly
every day, which accounts for the number of skin
diseases, from leprosy downward, which are direfully
prevalent. Matters are improving, however. More flax
is being spun up into fine linen. People of quality
change their clothes pretty often. Cotton and silk are
coming from the Levant at prices that permit the ordinarily
rich to command them. Wash day is even developing
into a fixed institution around most castles.
All this makes for health and comfort. Still, the great
majority of all garments are woolen; and, Holy saints!
how the fleas jump out of a villein's doublets whenever
you beat their wearer!</p>

<p>Conon normally dons the following peace-time garments.
First, his squire helps him into underdrawers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>of fine white linen; next come long hose which can be
of various fabrics or colors. Upon a gala day he will
proclaim himself to be a rich baron by wearing silk
hose; otherwise they are of fine wool. Good taste
forbids stockings of brilliant color, they should be
black, brown, or, at most, black with red stripes. After
that comes the chemise, a shirt of white linen, but <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sans</i>
cuffs or collar.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 252px;"><a id="i_107"></a>
  <img src="images/i_107.jpg" width="252" height="600" alt="A KING IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY WEARING PELISSON" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A KING IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY WEARING PELISSON</p>
<p class="center">Restored by Viollet-Le-Duc, from a manuscript of the Biblioth√®que
nationale.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The baron is now ready for his regular outer garments.
He will put on his pelisson. This is a long fur-edged
garment, very warm and pleasant in
winter when the castle is a barnlike
place. In summer it is often hot, and
as substitute one wears the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cotte</i> without
fur and made of very thin stuff.
Over the pelisson is thrown the bliaut,
a tunic, fairly loose, which is pulled on
over the head like a shirt. The best
bliauts are of silk, but for common use
one wears fustian or, perhaps, even
cotton. Finally, if the baron is going
abroad, he will swing his mantle over
his shoulders. It is a semicircular cape,
with a fur lining even in summer, and
very likely ornamented by many silk
tassels.</p>

<p>The shoemakers are already masters
of their art. Anybody can buy well-cobbled
leather shoes or high boots,
but if a nobleman wishes to dress in
state he will wear cloth shoes, and display
his wealth by having them plated with gold and
embroidered with jewels; for good taste here permits
elaborate ornaments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Women's Garments</div>

<p>Conon's most variable garment is his headdress.
In the house, or on state occasions, he wears a chaplet
of flowers, or even a thin gold wreath of floreated design;
outdoors he is likely to appear as do
meaner men, in a cloth bonnet&mdash;a kind
of Phrygian cap of bright color. If,
however, the weather is bad, he will
probably pull on a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chaperon</i>. This
is a combination cap and cape which
is drawn on over the head, and which
sticks up or is pulled back in a kind
of peak, at the same time covering
cheeks and shoulders, while the face
shows through a long slit cut in the
upper part.</p>

<p>These are the orthodox male garments,
while the female dress is much
the same, albeit with certain simplifications here and
elaborations <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'elsewere'">elsewhere</ins>. Adela's maids ordinarily put
upon her a long linen chemise, preferably white, which
descends to her knees. Over that comes the pelisson,
again with the fur edging. It can be made of some very
fine wool or silk, and falls over the chemise clear to her
feet. Above this again is the bliaut, sometimes worn
rather loosely, but more often close fitting and showing
off the figure. The baroness's maids lace it tightly and
take pains adjusting the long trailing sleeves. It is held
in place by a girdle of woven cords, preferably of silk.
The bliaut, of course, can be of very fine material, and
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'oramented'">ornamented</ins> with gold embroideries and pearl beadwork.
Finally there is the mantle, a loose trailing cloak, often
cut as a long semicircular cape and made, on gala occasions,
of the richest stuffs available.</p>

<p>Plenty of elegant fabrics can be had by the wealthy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
You can bring back from the Champagne fairs figured
silk, woven with silver and gold thread; also very heavy
silks woven with large threads of white, green or red.
This is the fair <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">samite</i> whereof the poets delight to sing.
But perhaps more useful is the thin, airy, shimmery
sendal silks, useful both for delightful summer garments
and for making those brilliant banners which noble
ladies give to the knights of their choice. Naturally,
too, there are plenty of Oriental silks, with strange
Egyptian and Persian figures. For humbler wear
(if homespun is not desired) you can buy all kinds of
of honest woolens; Flemish and Picard, Champagne
products, or those from Languedoc. They come in
serges and rough goods, as excellent as anyone could
ask. Linen is available bleached to a dazzling whiteness
for those who have the price; but cotton cloth is still
costly, although the mercers often spread out to the
ladies "silk at a marvelously low price" which is really
naught but cotton, woven up, perhaps, in Sicily.</p>

<p>However, the finest samite and sendal cannot take
the place of suitable furs. <em>Wearing furs is practically a
sign of nobility</em>, like wearing a sword or carrying a
hawk. Many a petty noble will cling to his frayed
tippet of black lambskin, even in the hottest weather,
merely to proclaim that he is not a villein. Fox- and
wolf-skins and civet are, of course, common, but your
high noble seeks something better. He will line his pelisson
and other garments with red or white marten, black
sable, with the gray of the beautiful northern squirrel,
and especially (if his purse can compass it) with ermine,
the precious fur of the white weasel. The choicest furs
probably come from those dim countries called "Russia."
You cannot make a noble friend a much more acceptable
present than a fine ermine skin; and many a baron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>has pledged lands to the Jews merely to satisfy his wife's
taste for miniver, a superior form of marten. In fact,
there is more extravagance over furs than over jewelry,
or even over falcons!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Luxurious Fashions</div>

<p>Fashions in dress do not change around St. Aliquis
so rapidly as in other ages, yet there are constant innovations.
For example, the surcoat is coming in. Originally
it was a longish woman's garment, but recently a fine
knight riding down from Rheims wore one cleverly
adapted to masculine necessities. It was a close, sleeveless
jacket cut short at the hips and made with big
armholes for easy movement. Conon must have one
very soon. Inevitably too, at the king's court all
kinds of new fashions, luxuries and ornamentations are
to be observed. Women cover themselves with gold
embroidery, wear gold buttons, and gold girdles set
alternately with agates and sapphires. They protect
their hands with chamois-skin gloves, and swing a silken
alms purse from silver chains at their belts. Fine
cavaliers load themselves with a dozen
buckles set with sardonyx, and pieces of
enamel, and even wear small emeralds
in the embroidery on their mantles.
Pointed shoes are coming much into
style, with the use of colored thongs
to bind them to the feet.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Yet the St. Aliquis simplicity is
hardly undermined. Except on f√™te
days the seigneur is not much better
clad than the upper servitors, and Adela never ceases
to warn her sister-in-law against extravagance of dress.
"Consider always your husband's rank and fortune, but
never disgrace them by seeming to devote too much study
to your costume or by constantly plunging into new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
fashions. Before leaving your room be sure your appearance
is neat, and see especially to it that the collar of
your gown is well adjusted and is not put on crooked."<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The dress of the humbler
folk is of the above nature, of
course simplified, and of more
sober hue. Blue is the color
of the baronial house and
nearly all its lord's followers
wear bliauts of that color.
This is their livery, because
twice per year there is a
distribution (a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">livraison</i>) of
garments to all whom Conon
undertakes to clothe and feed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 370px;"><a id="i_111"></a>

</div>


<p>Noble folk thus display
their rank by wearing furs.
They also show it by their
headdresses. When the baron
wishes to put on dignity he
assumes a velvet bonnet in
place of the ordinary cloth
one. On formal occasions,
however, this bonnet will be embroidered with gold
thread and become his "cap of presence." Sometimes
these caps are elaborated and made with a flattened
square top. These are the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mortiers</i>, and in generations
later great lawyers and doctors will wear the mortar-board
as a professional badge long after the high barons
have absolutely discarded the fashion.</p>

<p>As for the head covering of women, the thirteenth
century is as yet rather innocent of those towering
constructions of peaks and veils common in the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'suceeding'">succeeding</ins><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
age. Even noblewomen are usually content (as we
have seen) with the long braids of their hair intertwined
often with ribbons. If the sun is hot or the weather bad
they will wear thin veils or solid woolen hoods, according
to the seasons; and on gala days they will don either
floral chaplets or genuine crowns of gold and pearls,
according to the wealth of their fathers or husbands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hair Dressing and Beards</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;"><a id="i_112"></a>

</div>
</div>

<p>Conon's appearance differs from that
of his grandsire's in one important particular.
Until rather recently gentlemen
had their hair cut short in front,
although rather long behind, and wore
beards, often divided into a great
many little tufts which they might
even wind with gold thread. By 1200,
however, noblemen were usually
smooth shaven, although the hair was
allowed to grow to some length and
sometimes was arranged in little curls.
Thus ended a long struggle, for the Church has for
generations disapproved of lengthy beards; many a
bishop has warned that "they are the sign of the children
of Belial," and the great Pope Gregory VII uttered a
regular anathema against them. The reign of the barber
is renewed, and the St. Aliquis tonsor twice or thrice
per week scrapes over the chins of all the knightly males
in the castle. For the servitors and villeins, however,
there is no such luxury. All the humbler folk wear beards
of great bushiness, as well as unsanitariness; and their
hair is cut so seldom that often it can be almost braided
like the women's.</p>

<p>Every person of consequence wears a ring. Its signet
device is often equivalent to a personal signature. All
a man's friends know his ring and will give credence to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
messengers who produce the same. Women give rings to
their lovers, as well, of course, as receiving rings in
return. It is believed that many rings have charmed
virtues. Conon's signet has been in the family at least
since the First Crusade. It has a green Egyptian turquoise
cut with a serpent, and is called "The Luck of
St. Aliquis." The servitors profess confidence that so
long as the baron keeps this ring the castle cannot be
taken; and Fran√ßois has already had his head filled with
such stories as that of the father who on his deathbed
gave his son a ring, "the virtue of
which was that whosoever should wear
it should have the love of all men";
or the tale of Princess Rigmel, who
gave to her lover a ring so potent that
"whoever bore it upon him could not
perish; he need not fear to die in fire
or water, nor on the battlefield nor in
the m√™l√©es of the tournament."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 237px;"><a id="i_113"></a>

</div>

<p>Such are the ordinary articles of costume
and adornment. One need not
dwell on the buckles and brooches, the
golden pins and the jewel-set necklets
which Adela treasures in her coffers.
They come from Oriental, Byzantine,
or Venetian workshops. Some are very
beautiful, but fine jewelry, generally
speaking, has changed comparatively
little from age to age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cosmetics and False Hair</div>

<p>The baroness is not above certain
frivolities of toilet herself, but Alienor's
approaching marriage has given her fair opportunity to
admonish the younger lady on the sins of false adornments.
Indeed, these iniquities are thundered against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
nearly every Sunday at the churches, because the shrewd
preachers know that all the men in the congregation will
grin approval the fiercer the invectives become. Women
are regularly accused "of turning their bodies out of their
natural form" by means of laces and stays, of dyeing their
hair, of painting their faces. It is affirmed that David was
first impelled to desire Bathsheba because she combed her
long hair at a window too openly, and all her sore troubles
came justly upon her "for the overgreat attention which
she sinfully gave to the ornamenting of her head."</p>

<p>Then, in another sermon, there is approvingly repeated
the sarcastic story by the monk Guyot of
Provins, that the saints have brought suit at the Assize
of God against the race of women because the latter have
used so much color for their faces there is none left
wherewith to paint the holy images in the churches!
The noble ladies are told that when they smear on
vermilion, saffron, or quicksilver, or apply poultices of
mashed beans and mare's milk to improve their complexions,
they are adding centuries
to their durance in purgatory, if not
taking chances of eternal damnation.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;"><a id="i_114"></a>
  <img src="images/i_114.jpg" width="250" height="265" alt="COIFFURE OF A WOMAN" />
  <span class="caption">COIFFURE OF A WOMAN</span>
</div>

<p>Lastly, there is the iniquity of false
hair&mdash;as if the good God did not know
the proper amount of herbage to grow
from each female head! Once there
was a holy man who could heal the
sick. A young noblewoman suffered
from grievous headaches. The miracle
worker took one glance at her
towering headpiece. "First," said he, "remove that scaffolding
which surmounts your head. Then will I pray for
you with great confidence." The sacrifice was too great,
and she refused; yet erelong her anguish became unendurable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
and the holy man was recalled. He compelled
her to cast away all her false hair and colored bands and
swear never to resume them. Immediately then he began
to pray&mdash;and, behold! her headache departed.</p>

<p>These sermons and Adela's sisterly warnings produce
as much result as such admonitions can. Alienor will go
through life, now dreading for her comeliness and now
for her soul, but never quite imperiling either. Yet she
is surely less frivolous than the family rivals, the Foretvert
dames&mdash;who (tasteless creatures!) could adorn a
whole cathedral of saints' images with their paint
pots.</p>

<p>There are sometimes seen around St. Aliquis certain
obnoxious people who are compelled to wear conspicuous
garments in order that others may be warned and thus
avoid physical or moral contamination. If you meet a
man with a gray coat and a scarlet hat, pass at a distance&mdash;he
is a leper. If he has a big circle of saffron
cloth sewed on his breast, look to your money&mdash;he is a
Jew. If he has a cross sewed on each side of his breast,
say a prayer&mdash;he is a released heretic. Finally, if you
go to Pontdebois and come upon sundry unveiled females
in scarlet dresses, accost them not if you are a decent
man&mdash;they are women of the town.</p>

<p>At last we have seen the general nature of the garments
which are to make gay Alienor's wedding. It is
time for the wedding itself.</p>

<p class="mt2">Marriage, in noble families often does not mean the
union of two souls, but of two fiefs. The average baron
marries to extend his seigneury and to rear up sons to
defend it. A wife represents an estate and a castle.
Not many young men marry before they have been
knighted. After that they are glad to enter into holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
wedlock, for the normal way an aspiring young cavalier
whose father is living can gain independence is through
his wife's dowry, unless his father allows him a share of
the barony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ages for Marriage</div>

<p>Since young men are not often knighted until late in
their teens or even beyond twenty, weddings on their
side seldom take place early. Girls, however, become
marriageable sooner. South
Country troubadours assert
that love can begin to claim
a girl when she is thirteen;
she is then eligible for marriage.
If she has not "given
her heart" by the time she
is twenty-one there is no hope
for her, save in a nunnery;
and old maids find no recognized
place in society whether
in castle, city, or peasant hut.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Of course, couples can marry
younger than that. Not many
years earlier Count Baldwin VI of Hainault was
wedded to Countess Marie of Champagne. The bride
was only twelve, the bridegroom only fourteen. Boys
and girls are thus sometimes merely "so many pieces on
a chessboard," to suit the ambitions of guardians.</p>

<p>If a noblewoman's husband dies she need not expect to
be a widow very long, for a man is required to manage
her fief. It was one of the greatest proofs of Conon's
mother's strong character and ability that when his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>father died she prevented Baron Garnier from forcing
her into nuptials with one of his boon companions&mdash;a
roistering daredevil who, as guardian of her children,
would have ruined them, body and soul. Also, if an
heiress's husband does not prove suitable to the prevailing
powers, strange things can happen. In 1190,
when the crown of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Jersualem'">Jerusalem</ins> became vacant, Isabella
(the new queen) was forcibly separated from her husband,
the Seigneur Onfroy, by the barons of the Crusaders'
realm, and was given to a more powerful noble, Conrad of
Montferrat. Twice the poor queen's husbands died, and
twice her barons forced new spouses upon her. The
wishes of Isabella herself, who sincerely cared for Onfroy,
were in nowise consulted.</p>

<p>In all the romances you can find stories of marriages
consummated with amazing haste. There is, <i>e.g.</i>, the
tale of the old Baron Aimeri, who wished to find his son
an heiress. The lad, unaware of what was to happen,
was summoned into the presence of a duke, his father's
friend. "Young sir," said the duke, "you are of high
lineage. I am going to give you my pretty daughter."
The boy stood silent while the pucelle was brought in.
"Belle," said her father, "I have given you a husband."
"Blessed be God!" she replied promptly. The next to
come in was a bishop. The ceremony was immediately
over; the young people were mated for life, seemingly
before either could get his or her breath. Here, at least,
the lad was as much the helpless tool of his elders as was
the maid.</p>

<p>A story in the "Lorraine" romance makes the proceedings
hardly less precipitate. The Count of Flanders
is resolved to give his bereaved sister to his valiant
friend, Fromont. She had never seen this hero, but has
heard much about him. Suddenly her brother takes her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
by the hand, saying, "My beautiful and dear sister, let
us converse a little apart." Then he announces "to-morrow,
you shall have a husband." The lady protests
that she has been a widow only a month and has an
infant son. "You will do this, however, my sister,"
insists the count. "He whom I give you is far richer than
your first husband." Then he says much in praise of
Fromont, whereupon the lady responds, "Sire brother,
I will do according to your desires." Thereupon, runs the
story, "They did not wait a day, they did not wait an
hour. On the spot they proceeded to the church. Clerics
and priests were notified. There they were blessed and
married."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Church Control of Marriages</div>

<p>This is a strange state of things, but, fortunately, the
Church comes partly to the rescue. It demands first
that the maiden shall be at least fifteen years old (a
point sometimes waived), that she shall not be too
closely related to the man, and that she shall give her
"free consent" (another matter not always investigated).
The question of the "forbidden degrees" is,
however, a bar to many projected alliances. The
Church endeavored formerly to forbid the marriage of
cousins up to the seventh degree, but that rule had
proved unworkable, since god-parents were reckoned the
same as relatives. The Lateran Council of 1215 has
therefore ordained invalid marriages between cousins
through the <em>fourth</em> degree; and the saints know that
this rule makes complications enough, considering how
the great families are interrelated! Of course, the
regulations are wise, otherwise heiresses would always be
given in an outrageous manner to near kinsmen. On the
other hand, the forbidden degrees are sometimes a little
trenched upon to give the contracting parties an excuse
for repudiating each other in case they get tired of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
bargain&mdash;although here again is a practice which the
Church treats with just anger.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The Church does not formally permit divorce, but it
cannot thwart many of the currents of the age. Nobles
frequently repudiate their wives for trivial reasons&mdash;mere
ill health, for instance; and often the women take
the initiative. There are worldly bishops who will give
their help toward an annulment on grounds of "lack of
inward consent." Again, if a very desirable marriage
with a cousin comes in question, often a "dispensation"
can be obtained from the same complaisant authorities.
It is easy to become cynical if you study how easily the
"holy bonds of matrimony" can be put on and off by
the powerful, although sometimes a great pope like
Innocent III will teach even a mighty king a lesson, as
Philip Augustus learned when he tried to repudiate poor
Ingeborg of Denmark.</p>

<p>If a maiden has a father, a competent brother, or an
uncle she is lucky. Otherwise, the bestowal of her hand
belongs to her suzerain. This right to bestow heiresses
or the widows of vassals on faithful retainers is one of the
most precious privileges of a great seigneur. Many a
knight is kept loyal by the hope that presently his lord
will say: "One of my barons is dead without sons. I
will give you his fiefs and his daughter"; or, "Take the
widow of the late Sire X.... You may have the land
along with the lady." Under feudal usage it is well-nigh
impossible to deprive an heiress of her estates
directly, but her marriage practically gives her husband
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>the ownership of the property. No wonder the Duke of
Quelqueparte is anxious to see whether the sickly Count
of Greve is about to die and leave only a daughter, so that
he can secure the desirable allegiance of the Baron of St.
Saturnin, who has been a widower now these six months,
yet has remained still "uncomforted" just in hope of this
particular happening.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scandalous Relationships</div>

<p>What wonder if under these conditions strange
romances occur; if the lady gives "her love and kiss" to
some young knight, not her husband; if South Country
troubadours assert that "married couples cannot truly
love;" and if barons sometimes bring irregular consorts
straight into their castles, while perhaps winking at
their wives' uncanny doings? All this is true. Yet, as
stated before, not everything is bad. Girls are taught not
to expect too much of their spouses. They usually
accept the situation as they accept stormy or sunny
weather. Besides, if some fathers or guardians are
scandalously careless in disposing of their charges, many
fathers and brothers are full of honest affection and accept
the duty of marrying off their daughters or sisters as
a solemn responsibility; and if they are wise custodians
the results are usually happy. There is no need of pitying
Alienor too much because she has not the right to elope.</p>

<p>Conon has negotiated a most satisfactory marriage.
He will give his sister to Sire Olivier, the eldest son of
the Count of Perseigne. The Perseignes are a great
Burgundian family with many castles, and counts think
themselves a little higher in the social scale than do
barons, but St. Aliquis is also a powerful fief, and its
alliance will be useful to Perseigne when he has his expected
war with the Vidame of Dijon. Conon will
give the young couple his outlying Burgundian castle
(not of great value to himself) and the alliance will enable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
him to talk roundly to his uncivil neighbors. A
most excellent match; another sign that St. Aliquis has
an extremely sage seigneur!</p>

<p>Alienor is now nearly seventeen and has been thinking
about a wedding since before she was fifteen. Her
nurses have long since reviewed all the eligible cavaliers
for her. Her great dread has been lest she have to wed
some old and very stupid man&mdash;as befell her cousin
Mabila, who had been sent away tearful and pouting to
Picardy, the bride of a three-times widower. Who
can measure her relief when Conon declared he would
not give her to old St. Saturnin? It was all very well
for the jongleurs to sing, "An old man who loves a
young maiden is not merely old, but a fool!" The thing
has happened so often!</p>

<p>Her ideal is to have a "damoiseau (squire or young
knight) just with his first beard"&mdash;one who is brave,
valiant, and is, of course, courteous and handsome. She
had once hoped that Conon would give a great tourney
and award her to the conqueror; but this desire faded
when she learned that the victor in the last tourney was
ugly and brutal. She has been on very brotherly terms
with William, Conon's first squire, but William is still too
young, and it is not always honorable for a squire to
push intrigues in the house of his lord. Thus she is in a
very open state of mind when her brother says to her
one day: "Fair sister, I have arranged your marriage
with Olivier of Perseigne. He is a gallant cavalier. Any
maiden might rejoice to have him. Consider well what
I say because (here he adds a phrase which he hopes will
not be taken too literally) I would not have you wed him
against your wish."</p>

<p>If Alienor has anything against Olivier, if her antipathy
were violent and based on reason, Conon, as a genuinely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>affectionate brother, might give it weight; but in fact,
though she has met Olivier only a few times at a tourney,
at the Christmas f√™te at the Duke of Quelqueparte's
court, and once when he stopped at the castle, she has not
the least objection. He has certainly large blue eyes,
blond hair, a large nose, and a merry laugh. He is
reported to be kind to his servants, generous to a fault,
and not overgiven to drinking or brawling. At the
tourney he broke three lances fairly against a more
experienced knight. His family is excellent and her
brother's desires are obvious. She will not have to live
too far from St. Aliquis. What more could be said?
After a few hours of decent reflection she informs Adela
that she will comply with Conon's wishes. After that
the castle takes on a joyous activity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Betrothal Ceremonies</div>

<p>Before the wedding had come the betrothal. It was a
solemn ceremony, blessed by the Church. Sire Olivier
visited the castle with a great following of relatives and
met the shy and blushing Alienor. In the chapel, after
suitable prayers by Father Gr√©goire, the pair had awkwardly
enough exchanged their promises! "I will take
you for my wife." "And I for my husband." After this
there would have been great scandal had either side
turned back. The Church affirms energetically, however,
that betrothal is <em>not</em> marriage. Otherwise the
affianced pair might have considered themselves somewhat
wedded on trial, only to repudiate their obligations
later. Also, not merely the young couple, but their
parents or guardians, had to be present and add their
consent; and, of course, all the pledges were sworn to
over the holiest relics available.</p>

<p>Olivier, during all this happy time, has lodged at the
castle of a friendly vassal of St. Aliquis, and he rides over
frequently to visit his betrothed. He is excellently bred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
and knows everything expected of a prospective bridegroom
of good family. The alliance has been largely
negotiated by his parents, but he has been consulted,
understands that Alienor is witty and beautiful, and he is
wholly aware of the worldly advantages of being Conon's
brother-in-law. At meals he and his beloved are allowed
to sit together and above all to eat out of the same porringer,
when he delicately leaves to his intended all the
best morsels. He consults a competent jongleur, and
with his aid produces suitable verses praising his <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'finac√©e's'">fianc√©e's</ins>
beauty. He gives her a gold ring with both his own name
and hers engraved thereon. In return, besides a sleeve
and a stocking to hang on his lances (gifts which she has
already sent in mere friendship to other cavaliers), she
bestows a lock of her hair set around a gold ring; likewise
a larger lock which he may twine around his helmet.
The happy pair are permitted to take long walks together,
and to promenade up and down the garden, with
Olivier holding his lady in the politest manner by one
finger&mdash;the accepted method of showing intimacy.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>We have said that Conon is resolved to knight his
brother at the same time he gives his sister in marriage.
This involves holding a tourney and many other proceedings
really unnecessary for a wedding; but, of course,
it will attract a much greater number of guests and
advertise the prosperity of the baron of St. Aliquis to all
northwestern France. The knighting and tourney will
come after the bridal, however, and it is easier to explain
the two things separately. We omit the gathering of the
wedding guests&mdash;the coming of distant counts, barons,
and sires; the erection around St. Aliquis of a real village
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>of brilliant tents and pavilions; the ceremonious greetings;
the frenzied efforts of the castle folk to make all
ready; the inevitable despair, not once, but many times,
of Adela, who directs everything. At last it is the morning
of <em>the</em> day, in midsummer. No rain and, blessed be
St. Martin, not too much heat. Alienor is surrounded by
a dozen women, old and young, arraying her for her
wedding.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dressing the Bride</div>

<p>There is no regular bridal costume. Alienor does not
dress much differently from what she does on Easter or
at some other major festival. Her two great braids of
hair are weighted down over her breasts with an extra
intertwining with gold thread. Her chemise is of very
fine saffron-tinted linen. Her pelisson is completely
fringed with magnificent ermine, the gift of the Countess
of Perseigne, and the garment itself is made of two cloths
sewed together, the inner of fine wool, the outer of
beautiful bendal of reddish violet. The whole is laced
tightly until Alienor can hardly breathe. Above this
garment floats the elegant bliaut, of green silk with long
sleeves, many folds, and a long train. There is more silk
embroidery and elaborate flouncing. Fairest of all is the
girdle, made of many pieces of gold and each set with a
good-luck stone&mdash;agate to guard against fever, sardonyx
to protect against malaria, and many similar. In the
clasp are great sapphires which Baron Garnier originally
"acquired" from a town merchant shortly before he
hanged him. Finally, there is the mantle&mdash;again of silk
intricately embroidered and dyed with a royal purple.</p>

<p>Alienor's pointed shoes are of vermilion leather from
Cordova, with still more of gold-thread embroidery.
While one female minister is clasping these, her chief
pucelle is putting on a small saffron-colored veil, circular,
and held down by a golden circlet&mdash;a genuine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
crown; beautifully engraved and set with emeralds.
Inevitably the whole process of dressing is prolonged.
Alienor is too excited to feel hot or pinched, but her
attendants find her very exacting. They bless the
Virgin, however, that she is not as some noble brides,
who fly into a passion if every hair in their eyebrows is
not separately adjusted.</p>

<p>Meantime, in a secluded part of the castle, the groom
has been wrestling with a similar problem, assisted by his
two squires, although requiring less of time and agony.
His legs are covered with fine brown silk stockings from
Bruges; but it is effeminate to wear a silk shirt&mdash;one of
fine white linen will answer. His pelisson is like his
bride's, although less tightly laced&mdash;of cloth and silk,
trimmed with rich fur; and the outer color is pale red,
inevitably with much gold embroidery around the neck
and sleeves. His bliaut does not come below his knees,
but it is of blue sendal silk; his mantle is also edged
with fur and of the same color as his pelisson. Simple as
it is, it must hang exactly right. Everybody will ask,
"Did the groom wear his mantle like a great baron?"
The squires take a long time adjusting it. Olivier's
shoes are of very fine leather. On his crisply curled
hair they set a golden chaplet set with flashing gems&mdash;very
much like that worn by his bride.</p>

<p>Hardly are the happy twain ready before the wedding
procession forms in the bailey. So large a company
could never crowd into the castle chapel. It will go
across the bridge over the Claire to the parish church by
the village&mdash;a Gothic structure sufficiently pretentious
to suit the occasion. The Perseignes reckon a bishop
among their cousins, and he is on hand to officiate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marriage Procession and Ceremony</div>

<p>So the procession forms. Ahead go a whole platoon
of jongleurs puffing their cheeks for their flutes, twanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
their harps, or rasping their viols. The Feudal Age
delights in music, and does not mind if sometimes melody
is exchanged merely for a joyous noise. Alienor comes
next. She is on a black mule with extra long ears and a
finely curried shining coat. His harness is of gold and
his trappings of scarlet samite. She has been swung
into the saddle by her eldest brother ("Alas! that her
father, who should do this, is dead!" murmur all the
women), and he as her guardian leads the mule. Olivier
rides a tall white palfrey with a saddle of blue leather.
His mother, Adela, and all the St. Aliquis and Perseignes
female relatives follow on other mules, led by gayly
dressed squires. Then come all the noble guests, the
Duke of Quelqueparte at their head. No wonder there
is no work being done in all the villages for miles around,
and that all the villeins are lining the road, doffing caps,
and cheering as the dazzling cort√©ge sweeps past.</p>

<p>The details at the church we pass over. Among other
features to be noted is the fact that the bride is swung
down from her mule upon a great truss of straw, that
the bishop meets them at the sacred portal, and that
outside the actual building Olivier and Alienor exchange
those vows which form the essential part of the marriage
ceremony. After that Conon's chief provost recites in
loud voice all the estates, horses, fine garments, and
servitors which the bride brings as her dowry. This
customary publication may avert bitter disputes later.
Next the happy pair scatter newly coined silver deniers
among the swarm of ill-favored mendicants permitted to
elbow and scramble among the more pretentious guests.</p>

<p>Finally, the church is thrown open. The great nave
opens mysterious and dark, but galaxies of candles are
burning and the lofty stained-glass windows gleam like
jewels. Olivier and Alienor occupy seats of honor in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
choir, while the bishop says the very solemn mass of the
Trinity and pronounces a special blessing over them.
"Let this woman," intones the prelate, "be amiable as
Rachel, wise as Rebecca, faithful as Sarah. Let her be
sober through truth, venerable through modesty, and
wise through the teaching of Heaven."</p>

<p>So at last the mass ends. The "Agnus Dei" is chanted.
The bridegroom advances to the altar and receives
from the bishop the kiss of peace. Then he turns, and
right at the foot of the great crucifix embraces his wife
and transmits the kiss to her. This act completes the
ceremony. Away the whole company go from the church.
They have been condemned to silence for nearly two
hours, and are glad now to chatter like magpies. When
back at St. Aliquis they find the great hall has been
swept, garnished, and decorated as never before. The
walls of the hall are hung with the pictured tapestries
or beautiful pieces of red and green silk. Your feet crush
fresh roses and lilies scattered on the floor. Alienor
almost bursts with delight at the number of high-born
cavaliers and dames who press up to kiss and congratulate.
All the remainder of her life she will match weddings
with her friends: "I had so many counts and
barons at my marriage." "But I had so many!"</p>

<p>All these guests, however, expect to receive presents&mdash;bliauts,
mantles, goblets, and other things, each suitable
to the recipient. It is well that Conon has saved many
livres in his strong box. The presenting of the gifts by
the host is quite a ceremony; each article has to be
accompanied by a well-turned speech. By the time this
reception to the bride and groom is over the trumpets
sound furiously. They tell that the feast is ready in
the fragrant garden under the trees. There is a fine tent
of blue silk for the bridal party and the more exalted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
guests. All the others must sit on long tables open to
the glad sunshine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Marriage Feast</div>

<p>What Messire Conon's guests have to eat and drink
is so serious a topic that we must tell thereof separately.
We speak here merely concerning the festivities of the
wedding. Olivier and Alienor are served by two barons
as squires of state. The groom drinks from a great
goblet, then sends it to his wife, who ceremoniously
finishes the draught. In the bridal tent there is a reasonable
amount of decorum, but elsewhere (Blessed martyrs!)
what noise and tumult! All the villeins appear to be
there, and burghers have even wandered up from Pontdebois.
It will never do to have men say, "The bride
was charming, but her brother stinted his hospitality."
Enough food and drink is gorged and guzzled to stave
off a famine next winter. The jongleurs keep quiet
during the first part of the feast; later they earn their
dinner by singing of the loves of Jourdain and Orabel
or of Berte, who was the faithful wife of Girard of
Roussillon through all of her lord's adversity. At many
of the tables the jesting and horseplay become unspeakably
ribald. After the wine circulates two petty nobles
quarrel; one strikes the other with a drinking cup, but
the sergeants pull them apart before they can whip
out swords.</p>

<p>After three hours of this some guests are sleeping
stertorously under the trees; but those nobles who have
kept their wits go to another large tent, and, despite
their heavy meal, dance with vigor. The bride and groom
are expected to dance together, and everybody is prepared
to admire the beauty of one and the grace and
strength of the other. As evening advances a priest
appears. He solemnly blesses the nuptial couch strewn
with roses, while the new couple piously kneel. The couch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
is then "censed" like an altar, and the women guests
join in the bizarre usages of "putting the bride to bed."</p>

<p>The morning after the marriage the newly wedded
pair attend mass in the castle chapel. Here they are
expected to make privately all kinds of vows of good
conduct, and Alienor especially promises always to
obey her husband, and call him dutifully "mon sire"
and "mon baron."</p>

<p>The festivities will last two weeks longer, and conclude
with the dubbing of knights and the tournament,
whereof more presently. After that Olivier and his
wife will depart for their Burgundian castle without
anything like a honeymoon to strange parts....</p>

<p>So they celebrate the wedding at St. Aliquis. Very
far is it from being a love match of a later day; yet
there is a decent hope of happiness for the two most
deeply interested. A new spirit in the relations of men
and women has been creeping into the world since
Greek and Roman days, and if this spirit too often
manifests itself in illicit romances it is something if
romantic love can exist at all, and if, also, in many an
instance (as the jongleurs already like to tell us), their
story can run that "thus the twain were wedded, and
forevermore lived together happily."</p>

<p>It was as early as about 1160 that the South Country
troubador, Bernart de Ventadoun, sang about the great
motive which was coming to add beauty to the world:</p>

<div class="poem mb2"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"For indeed I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of no more subtle passion under heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than is the maiden passion for a maid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not only to keep down the base within a man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But teach high thought and amiable words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And courtliness and the desire of fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love of truth, and all that makes a man!"<br /></span>

<h2>Chapter VII: Cookery and Mealtimes.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_130.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">N</span>ow it is as certain as that God reigns in
heaven, that if one desires a wedding and
a tournament, although the first thought
must be of raiment, the second must be
of food and drink. When Conon bids
Adela make ready for the festivities,
straightway that prudent dame sends for the butler and
the cellarer and takes account of everything stowed away
in the great vaults under the castle. Then she orders
the chief huntsman muster all his beaters and course the
forests, not for sport, but for victuals. At the same time
nets are set out in the Claire; purveyors with their carts
are ordered up from Pontdebois, and a messenger is
even sent to Troyes to bring back a tun of rare Grecian
wine. All available maids from the village are requisitioned
to make great pasties, and a master cook is
imported from Paris to prepare special cakes and pastries.
In short, it is no light thing even for the huge
St. Aliquis household to prepare to feed several thousands
without aid of those miracles which caused five loaves
and two fishes to suffice in the days of our Blessed Lord.</p>

<p>For the baron's feast the great fireplace in the bailey
cookhouse is insufficient. They build fires in the open
out in the tilt yard or garden and all day perspiring
varlets stand feeding on great logs over which roast
long spits of chickens and geese, or boil caldrons of meat.
In the cookhouse, where the finer dishes must be prepared,
the master cook has a true arsenal of utensils&mdash;pots,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
trivets, mortar and pestle, a table for mincing
herbs, pothooks, caldrons, frying pans and gridirons,
saucepans, platters, a pepper mill, dressing board, scummer,
ladle, and many things else. There is no lack of
help in the kitchen. Half a dozen loutish boys gladly
work there all day long (receiving, incidentally, many
of the cook's hard knocks) in return for being allowed
to lick the pans and gnaw the scraps, so cheap is human
labor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cookery and Mealtimes</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>On ordinary days we would marvel at the quantity
of boiled meat served at St. Aliquis. About the only
way to preserve meat is to salt it (the vats of the castle
are full of salted meat kept against winter or a siege),
and this flesh must ordinarily be boiled. The result is
that a great copper meat pot seems always in action,
with a boy pumping the bellows to make the caldron
bubble. But fowls and fresh meat are often boiled as
well. Butcher's meat, however, is less welcome at feasts
than is game. An ideal dish is a stag, roasted whole in
the great fireplace, crisped and larded, then cut up into
quarters and served on very large plates. Upon such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
dishes is poured a hot, steaming pepper sauce. Therefore
a stag will be served at the wedding banquet besides
many other kinds of choice game.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_132"></a>
  <img src="images/i_132.jpg" width="400" height="261" alt="PORK BUTCHERS (BOURGES)" />
  <span class="caption">PORK BUTCHERS (BOURGES)</span>
</div>

<p>Since there are no iceboxes, unsalted meat must be
eaten soon after being killed, although your feudal
epicure is not squeamish. Beef and mutton are often
killed, cut up, and
cooked almost on the
spot. There is a story
of a butcher who, coming
late to a town, got
a lodging at the
priest's house, and to
pay for his quarters
killed the sheep which
they ate for supper.
But pork is probably
the commonest meat. Conon has great droves of
hogs fattening out in his oak forests, which supply
abundant crops of acorns. Pigs seem to penetrate almost
everywhere save into messire's and madame's chamber.
They are the general scavengers and apparently replace
plumbing and sewerage systems. They infest castle
courts and the streets of towns. In 1131 the Crown
Prince of France was killed in Paris by a pig which ran
between the legs of his horse as he rode from the Hotel
de Ville to the Church of St. Gervais. People will tell
you that pork promotes leprosy, but, nevertheless, they
devour it. Pork, too, is the main substance of those
great sausages and black puddings in which everybody
delights, especially on Easter, when you break your
Lenten fast with as much heavy food as possible. Veal,
too, is desirable, as is the flesh of kids; but lamb is by no
means so much in favor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>Almost all kinds of birds are counted edible. Herons,
cranes, storks, cormorants, and such fowl as can be taken
by hawks are in preference, but crows are considered
very fair eating. The flock of stately swans by the mouth
of the Rapide has just been depleted, for these elegant
birds are kept for the kitchen rather than for ornament.
As for small fowl&mdash;thrushes, starlings, blackbirds, quail,
partridges, and cuckoos&mdash;the varlets can bring in as
many as possible with their crossbows and snares.
Young rabbits, likewise, are welcome, but older rabbits
are too tough save for the diet of the least-considered
villeins. Everybody knows the saying, "An old hare
and an old goose are food for the devil!"</p>

<p>There is plenty of poultry around St. Aliquis. Most
Christians hold that birds are of aquatic origin, hence,
like fish, can be eaten on fast days, although the Church
opposes this opinion, and is slowly overcoming it.
Chickens have been fattened for the feast by shutting
them up in dark coops and gorging them. Droves of
geese have been coming in from the fields, great honking
armies, crowding the narrow way, hissing and biting,
but all propelled steadily ahead by the cracking whips
of the small goosegirls. Ducks are more commonly
preferred in their wild stage; but out in the exercise
ground several peacocks have been preening themselves,
and at least two of these are now sacrificed to make a
gala dish to serve the highest seigneurs, for peacocks
are counted especial "food for the brave." Indeed, there
is the old proverb that "thieves have as much taste for
falsehood as a hungry man for a cooked peacock."<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Fish is hardly in great request. One is likely to have
too much of it on the numerous fast days. Still, out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
the Claire they draw excellent barbel and eels; there
are carp in a near-by pond, and splendid trout in the
brooks that feed the Rapide. The lads bring in many.
If you go to Paris you can eat salt herring taken in the
North Sea. All through the spring, furthermore, the
St. Aliquis folk have had their fill of frogs' legs from the
castle moat and the numerous bogs, and Conon has a
"snail bed" to provide snails for garnishings and salads
during Lent and on Fridays.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Game Birds and Poultry</div>

<p>One cannot stay at the castle long and not discover
the vast importance of soup. One partakes thereof at
least twice per day: "dried peas and bacon water," watercress
soup, cabbage soup, cheese soup, and "poor man's
soup" (made up of odds and ends collected on short
warning), and fish soups for Lent. All the better soups
are spiced with marjoram, sage, and sweet basil, if not
with the favorite condiment, pepper. But what are
soups compared with meat pies? Whenever the castle
cook is in doubt how to please their lordships he decides
upon a noble pasty. Much thought has been concentrated
upon this subject. There are little poems to
be memorized by illiterate cooks explaining this triumph
of their mystery&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, that they should use "three
young partridges large and fat, not forgetting six quail
put on their side"; add to these thrushes, some bacon,
some sour grapes, and a little salt. Then if all is made
aright, the crust nicely rolled of pure flour, and the
"oven of proper heat with the bottom quite free from
ashes," when all is baked enough "you will have a dish
to feast on"! Other pasties can be made of chickens,
venison, salmon, eels, pigeons, geese, and other kinds
of meat. Probably, in fact, more energy goes into making
the pasties than into any other one form of culinary effort.</p>

<p>The St. Aliquis folk are not at all vegetarians, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
they cannot eat meat forever, and the poorer peasants
seldom touch flesh save on important feast days. The
cooks have at their disposal onions and garlic, cabbages
and beets, carrots and artichokes, lentils and both long
and broad beans, peas, turnips, lettuce, parsley, water
cress&mdash;in short, nearly all the vegetables of a different
age save the all-important potato. Turnips are in
favor, and figure in far more dietaries than they will
do later. Cabbages, too, are in request: there are
Roman white cabbages, huge Easter cabbages, and
especially the Senlis cabbages, renowned for their
excellent odor. Cucumbers are supposed to cause fever,
but Herman raises some in the garden for the salads.</p>

<p>As always, bread is the staff of life. Naturally, the
villeins have to use flour that is very coarse and made
of barley, rye, or oats&mdash;producing black bread, before
which noble folk shudder. It is one of the signs of
messire's prosperity that all his household are ordinarily
fed on white bread. In the castle ovens they make a
great variety of loaves&mdash;huge "pope's" or "knight's"
loaves, smaller "squire's" loaves, and little "varlet's"
loaves, or rolls. There is a soft bread made of milk and
butter, a dog bread, and two-color bread of alternate
layers of wheat and rye. Then there are the table
loaves, sizable pieces of bread to be spread around the
tables, from which courteous cavaliers will cut all the
crust with their knives and pass the remainder to the
ladies, their companions, to soak up in their soup. The
servants have less select common bread, although it is
still wheaten. Finally, there are twice-baked breads,
or crackers. These are often used in monasteries, also
in the provisioning of castles against a siege.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Breads, Pastries and Cheese</div>

<p>Fancy jellies, pastries, and sweet dishes are coming
into vogue, although they have not reached the perfection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
to be attained by later French cookery; but for the St.
Aliquis feast they are able to prepare great molded
structures of lions and suns, made of white chicken and
pink jelly. The quantity of spices used is simply enormous.
To enjoy food thus charged, especially with
pepper, is an acquired taste, which developed following
the First Crusade. The cooks, too, use a liberal supply
of mustard, and a favorite sauce is made from strong
garlic. Fresh and pickled olives are sent up from Provence,
likewise a good deal of olive oil; but the oil used
in common cooking is often extracted from walnuts or
even from poppies. Another favorite flavoring is with
rose water. All through June you can see great basins of
water filled with rose petals steeping in the sun. The
liquor thus obtained will add zest to sauces for the next
twelve months. There is also a certain whitish substance
known as "sugar." It comes from the Levant, in small
irregular lumps. Its flavoring qualities are delightful,
but it is too expensive to use in cookery. A small quantity
is passed about among Conon's higher guests, to be
eaten as a confection. The ordinary sweetening is still
that of the Greeks and Romans, honey, supplied from the
well-kept hives of the bees belonging to the monastery.</p>

<p>Cheeses hardly figure in feasts, but for everyday diet
they are important. On feast days they often replace
meat. Their varieties are legion&mdash;white, green, large,
small, etc. Some places produce famous cheeses exported
all over France, and in Paris one can hear the street
venders shrilly chanting:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
"Buy my cheese from Champagne,
Or my cheese from Brie!"</div>

<p>As for eggs and butter, they are gifts of the kindly
saints, to carry men through Lent and fast days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
Theologians have said that hens were aquatic creatures,
like other birds; that hence good Christians could eat
their eggs freely. But butter (by some unaccountable
notion) if eaten during times of abstinence, must be
freshly churned. It must not be salted, nor used for
cooking purposes.</p>

<p>Passing next to beverages, be it said that the St.
Aliquis denizens are fairly abstemious folk. All of them
sometimes get tipsy, even Adela and Alienor, but only
seldom. Conon's servants help him to bed once or twice
per year. Down in the villages there are disgraceful
guzzlings among the peasants, especially on saints' days.
But the beverages are not very alcoholic&mdash;one must
absorb a great deal to be really upset. The region grows
its own wine for ordinary consumption, and a little
thereof is shipped to Paris and even to Flanders and
England, along with the more famous vintages of Gascony,
Saintonge, Macon, Rheims, the Marne, and the Orleanais.
The most desirable French wine is that of St.
Pourcain, in Auvergne, and the baron has a carefully
cherished tun of the same in his cellars. Poems, indeed,
exist in praise of this St. Pourcain wine, "which you
drink for the good of your health." On occasions of
great state, however, imported wines will be produced,
mainly because they are unusual and expensive. The
St. Aliquis feasters are consequently offered heady
Cyprian and Lesbian from the Levant, also Aquilian
from Spain, and not a little Rhenish from the German
lands, less distant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wine, Beer and Other Drinks</div>

<p>In the autumn when the apples and pears are falling,
the peasants will make cider and perry, and get outrageously
drunk when these beverages grow hard; but
outside of Normandy such drink seldom appeals to
castle folk. There are also in common use many substitute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>wines, really infusions of wormwood, hyssop, and rosemary,
and taken mostly to clear the system; although
"nectar" made of spices, Asiatic aromatics, and honey
is really in request.</p>

<p>The great competitor of wine is beer. In northern
France we are in the dividing zone between the land of
the winepress and the land of the brewhouse. Everybody
drinks beer and makes beer. The castle has a
great brewhouse; likewise the monastery. Beer is made
of barley, and only late in the Middle Ages will hops
be added to add to the zest. Really fine beer is <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">god-ale</i>
(from the German "good" and "ale") or "double
beer." Common beer is "small beer." Since the
Crusaders have returned from the East, spiced beer has
been growing in favor&mdash;charged with juniper, resin,
gentian, cinnamon, and the like, until the original taste
has been wholly destroyed.</p>

<p>The St. Aliquis folk do not, however disdain buttermilk.
This they like to ferment, boil up with onions
and garlic, then cool in a closed vessel. The product is
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">serat</i>, the enjoyment of which is surely difficult for a
stranger.</p>

<p>Another form of beverage is not quite unknown.
Some physicians prescribe water of gold and allege it
"prolongs health, dissipates superfluous matters, revives
the spirits, and promotes youth." Also it "greatly
assists the cure of colic, dropsy, paralysis, and ague."
Of a surety, it aids the patient temporarily to forget his
troubles. Yet this is hardly more than a costly medicine.
Many years later it will become more common; but its
name will be changed to "brandy."</p>

<p class="mt2">The usages even of a great dinner depend largely on
the customs of everyday life. One cannot understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
the splendors of the marriage feast of Sire Olivier and
Alienor without knowing what goes on regularly in
the hall of St. Aliquis.</p>

<p>When the day is started we have seen how everybody
arises to a very light breakfast of bread and wine,
although sometimes, as in the epic of Doon of Mayence,
when the work promises to be arduous, the baron's squire
may bring him a favorite pasty because "eating early
in the morning brings health and gives one greater
courage and spirit." Dinner also, we have discovered,
can begin as early as nine in the morning, and a good part
of the day's business comes after this heavy meal.
Sometimes when dinner is late you do not serve your
guests any regular supper, but when they go to bed
have the attendants bring cakes and fruits and wine.
If you entertain guests, however, always it is proper to
try to make them eat and drink as much as possible.
There is a story of an overhospitable Count of Guines
who not merely constrained any knight passing through
his dominions to a feast, but kept quantities of white
wine always on hand, so that if his visitors asked to
have their red wine diluted with water, they might be
hoodwinked by seeing a white liquid mixed in their
goblets. In this way he once rendered the whole suite
of a bishop gloriously intoxicated!</p>

<p>The ingenious Bartolomes of Granvilla has laid down
the following requisites for an ideal banquet: (1) a
suitable hour, not too early nor too late; (2) a pleasant
place; (3) a gracious and liberal host; (4) plenty to eat,
so one may choose one's dishes; (5) the same as to things
to drink; (6) willing servants; (7) agreeable company;
(8) pleasant music; (9) plenty of light; (10) good
cooking; (11) a seasonable conclusion; (12) quiet and
repose afterward. A marriage feast and a tourney can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
hardly provide this twelfth desideratum, but they ought,
with proper management, to supply everything else.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Service at Table</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_140"></a>
  <img src="images/i_140.jpg" width="400" height="182" alt="SERVANTS BRINGING THE FOOD TO THE TABLE" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">SERVANTS BRINGING THE FOOD TO THE TABLE</p>
<p class="center">From a manuscript of the thirteenth century in the library of Munich (Schultz).</p>
</div></div>

<p>The tables for the notables are laid and served by two
classes of attendants; first by Conon's three squires,
aided on this grand occasion by several young nobles
who have actually received knighthood; second, by
the older professional servitors of villein stock. The
first class of attendants are resplendent in bliauts of
colored silk with fur trimmings. Most of the dishes
will be passed to them by the soberly clad villeins, then
to be presented on bended knee by noble hands to noble
guests. The whole process is under Sire Eustace, the
old seneschal, who orders about his platoons of attendants
with as much precision as he might command
the men at arms for defense of the castle.</p>

<p>It is part of a squire's education to learn to wait on
table. One may have to do this for some superior all
one's life, unless one be king or emperor! Conon's
squires have been taught to stand at perfect ease; not
to roll their eyes or stare blankly; not to laugh save
when guests are laughing; to keep their finger nails
clean and hands well washed. If they sit at table themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
they are models of propriety. They do not gobble
down their food, but put a little from every plate into
the basket of collected leavings for the poor; they do
not chatter, nor fill their mouths too full, nor chew on
both sides of the mouth at once, nor laugh or talk with
a mouthful, nor make a noise by overeating, nor handle
cats or dogs during mealtime, nor wipe their knives on
the tablecloth, nor pick their teeth publicly, nor wipe
their noses with their fingers, nor (last but not least)
spit across the table or beyond it.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The tables are nearly always long and narrow. In the
great hall they are fixed and of heavy oak planks, but
there are plenty of light tables of boards to be set on
horses, if the seneschal suddenly says, "The weather is
fine; Messire will dine in the garden." The favored
guests are provided with cushions, and, of course, in
the hall the baron and his immediate friends and family
sit on the long master-seat on the dais, facing the company,
and with the baron's own chair under a canopy.
This canopy is the sign of high seigneurial privilege. One
will be set for Conon even when he sits in the garden;
and he will never surrender his place save when he
entertains a superior, like his suzerain the duke, or
when, as at present, all other claims fade before those
of a bridal couple.</p>

<p>Indoors or outdoors, it is no mean art to lay the tables.
Enormous tablecloths have to be spread out smoothly,
and set with napkins neatly doubled; also at each place
a suitable drinking vessel, and a knife and spoon. These
articles, gold or silver, are carefully handed out by the
seneschal. They represent a good fraction of the portable
wealth of the castle and must be laboriously counted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
before and after use. The knives are sharp steel for
serious business. The drinking cups are often of bizarre
forms&mdash;lions, birds, and dragons, while for the humbler
folk there are huge cups of wood and also large "jacks"
of leather. At every place, too, there must be a good-sized
cake of fine white flour, and between every two
places there is a large porringer (pewter or silver) to be
shared by each pair of guests.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Entering the Dining Hall</div>

<p>Feast day or fast day, it is the loud blast on trumpets
which sends the mighty and the humble bustling toward
the garden or the hall. Of course, at a wedding feast
there is some little formality, but ordinarily in the St.
Aliquis household the good-natured jostling and scampering
is prodigious. Men and women live close to
nature and are always conscious of rousing appetites.
On ordinary days when you entered the baron's hall,
you would take your turn at the lavatory close to the
entrance. Here would be several little washstands with
pitchers and basins, and everybody would fall in line
in order of precedence: first, any visiting clergy; then
visiting knights; then the seigneur's family, etc. The
hand washing presents a great chance for flirtation among
the young: Olivier and Alienor had great delight "passing
the towel" to each other during their betrothal.
But now at a great festival, when you enter the special
banqueting tent you are met by two handsome varlets.
The first holds a water jug and a small basin. Water is
dexterously poured over your fingers, and as promptly
wiped off by the second varlet, and each guest patiently
waits until the persons ahead have enjoyed this courtesy.
So they enter the tent, and the magnates make for
the seats of honor.</p>

<p>The placing of the company has been a matter of
serious deliberation between Messire Conon and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
sage Sire Eustace. Of course, to-day the bride and
groom take the canopy. At Olivier's right must be the
officiating bishop. At the bishop's right must be the
suzerain Duke of Quelqueparte, and at Olivier's left
must be the bride and the Count and Countess of
Perseigne. All that is standardized. But how locate
the dozen other counts and barons who, with their dames,
have honored the bridal? Will the old rival Foretvert
stomach it now if he is seated farther from the canopy
than the Count of Maric, who is richer and of a more
ancient house? Bloody feuds have started from failure
to seat guests properly. It is a matter for supreme
diplomacy. So far as possible, a lady is placed beside
each cavalier. The two will use the same dish and the
same goblet during the entire feast&mdash;obviously another
case where one is compelled to test one's brains while
selecting partners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Serving the Banquet</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_143"></a>
  <img src="images/i_143.jpg" width="400" height="206" alt="YOUNG GIRLS OF THE NOBILITY SERVING AT THE TABLE" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">YOUNG GIRLS OF THE NOBILITY SERVING AT THE TABLE</p>
<p class="center">From a thirteenth-century manuscript of the library of Munich (Schultz).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>So the feast begins after grace by the bishop. An
endless procession commences between the cookhouse
and the banqueting place&mdash;boys running with great
dishes which they commit to the more official servitors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
to pass to the guests. It is a solemn moment, followed
by cheering, when into the bridal tent, with clash of
cymbals and bray of trumpet, Sire Eustace in a bright
scarlet bliaut enters, waving his white wand and followed
by all the squires and upper servants, each carrying
shoulder high a huge dish of some viand. A great
haunch of the stag is set on the table. The baron's
carver cuts ample slices, while two jongleurs blow at
their flutes. He holds the meat "by two fingers and a
thumb" (no fork), plying a great knife as a surgeon
might his scalpel. Equal skill is demanded of the cup-bearers
when they fill the flagons, not spilling a drop.
Even the bride and groom are now hungry and ready
for the venison.</p>

<p>The banqueters have little need of plates. They take
the loaves lying ready, hack them into thick slices,
place the pieces of meat upon the same, then cut up the
meat while it is resting on the bread. These "trenchers"
(<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tranchoirs</i>) will not ordinarily be eaten at the feast;
they go into the great alms basket for the poor, along
With the meat scraps. However, the higher guests to-day
enjoy a luxury. Silver plates are placed under their
bread trenchers. For most guests, however, the bare
tablecloth is bottom enough for these substitutes for
the porcelain of another day. Whatever does not go
into the alms basket will be devoured by the baron's dogs,
who attend every meal by prescriptive right. Indeed,
early in the feast the Duke of Quelqueparte benevolently
tosses a slice of venison to a fine boarhound.</p>

<p>Time fails to repeat all the good things which Conon
and Adela set before their guests. The idea is to tempt
the appetite to utter satiety by forcing first one dish upon
the feasters, and then another. There is not really a good
sequence of courses. Most of the dishes are heavy; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
inasmuch as vegetables are in great demand on common
occasions, the average banquet seems one succession of
varieties of meat. The noble folk in the bridal pavilion
have at least a chance to eat their fill of these comestibles:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Typical Bills-of-Fare</div>

<p>First course: Slices of stag, boar's head larded with
herb sauce, beef, mutton, legs of pork, swan, roasted
rabbit, pastry tarts.</p>

<p>Second course: Pottage of "drope and rose" mallard,
pheasant and roast capon, pasties of small birds.</p>

<p>Third course: Rabbits in gravy heavily spiced with
onion and saffron; roasted teal, woodcock and snipe;
patties filled with yolk of eggs, cheese, and cinnamon,
and pork pies.</p>

<p>No salads, no ices, no confectionery; nevertheless,
some of the dishes are superb&mdash;notably the swan, which
is brought once more on with music, prinked out as if he
were alive and swimming, his beak gilt, his body silvered,
resting on a mass of green pastry to represent a grass field,
and with little banners around the dish, which is placed on
a carpet of silk when they lay it on the table. The cooks
might also serve a peacock with outspread plumage.
Instead, toward the close of the repast, two squires
tug in an enormous pasty. Amid an expectant hush
Conon rises and slashes the pasty open with a dagger.
Instantly out flutter a score of little birds which begin
to dash about the tent; but immediately the baron's
falconers stand grinning at the entrance. They unhood
a second score of hawks which in a twinkling pounce
after the wretched birds and kill them, to the shouts and
delight of the feasters, right above the tables. Inevitably
there is confusion, rustling by the ladies and merry
scrambling, before the squawking hawks can be caught,
hooded, and taken away. In fact, from the beginning the
feast is extremely noisy. Everybody talks at once. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>appearance of the stag has started innumerable hunting
stories. The duke has to tell his loyal lieges how he
slew a bear. Two of the baron's dogs get to fighting
and almost upset the chair of a countess. Everything
is very merry.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_146"></a>
  <img src="images/i_146.jpg" width="400" height="292" alt="A FEAST OF CEREMONY IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A FEAST OF CEREMONY IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY</p>
<p class="center">It was the custom during the repast to bring in enormous p√¢t√©s which held little live birds: these flew about the
hall when the crust of the p√¢t√© was broken; immediately the servants loosened falcons which gave chase. This part
of the feast is represented here.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>If an elaborate dinner had been required on a so-called
fast day, the cooks could still have met the
occasion and yet have kept within the commands of the
Church; although not merely would there have been much
fish, but also more vegetables. The guests could have
been served with roast apples garnished with sorrel and
rosemary; then might have come a rich soup made of
trout, herring, eels salted twenty-four hours, and salt
whiting soaked twelve hours, almonds, ginger, saffron,
and cinnamon powder. If possible to bring them up
from the ocean, there would have been soles, congers,
turbots, and salmon&mdash;and in any case these can be
had salted&mdash;the rivers in turn supply pike (preferably
with roe), carp, and bream. For side dishes there can
be lampreys, porpoise, mackerel, and shad served with
juice of crab apples, rice, and fried almonds. Finally
might come stewed or ripe fruits&mdash;figs, dates, grapes, and
filberts; the whole washed down with spiced wine
(hippocras). To the minds of men of a later age this
fast-day dinner might seem only a little less gorging than
the orthodox feast upon meats.</p>

<p>But elaborate as is this wedding banquet, at last
everybody has had his fill. The concluding baked pears,
the peeled walnuts, dates, and figs have been passed.
The noble dames have chewed their unfamiliar sugar
plums. A last cup of spiced wine is handed around,
but nobody has drunk too much to become worse than
merrily talkative. Before rising the guests have all
very properly "thought of the poor," called in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
servitors and piled all the loose food upon great platters
to be kept for the needy. To-day, in fact, all the indigent
in the region are eating voraciously at the outer tables,
but on the morrow of a festival day you will see a great
collection of halt, sickly, and shiftless hanging around
the barbican in just expectation that Conon and Adela
will order a distribution.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>At last the bishop returns thanks; basins, pitchers, and
towels are again carried around. Then the guests rise,
some to mingle with the less exalted visitors outside,
some to repose under the shade trees, some to listen to
the jongleurs who are now tuning their instruments,
and many (especially the younger) to get ready for the
thing we have seen they liked almost the best&mdash;extremely
vigorous dancing.</p>

<p>Outside of the state pavilion the service has naturally
been less ceremonious and the fare less sumptuous, but
all of the countryside has been welcome to wander into
the castle gardens and to partake. Greasy, unkempt
villeins have been elbowing up to the long tables, snatching
joints of meat, bawling to the servitors to refill their
leather flagons, and throwing bits of cheese and bread
around in an outrageously wasteful manner. Thousands
of persons, apparently many of whom will be happy if
they can have black bread all through the winter, are
trying to-day to avenge past hunger by devouring and
drinking just as much as possible. Sire Eustace is
continually calling; "Another tun of wine! Another
vat of beer! Another quarter of beer!" These viands for
the multitude are not select, but there are bread, flesh,
and drink without stinting. Fortunate it is that Conon
has not <em>two</em> marriageable sisters, or there would be
naught left to eat on the seigneury!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">Wholesale Hospitality</div>

<p>As the shadows lengthen everybody seems satisfied.
The villeins and petty nobles lay down their flagons.
Groups of friends, if sufficiently sober, begin to sing
songs in a round, each member improvising a doggerel
verse, and the group thundering out the chorus. But
many of the guests do not retain wits enough for recreations.
While their noble hosts are dancing, the others
throw themselves on the grass in companies to watch or
listen to the jongleurs: then as the wedding dances
finish, Olivier and Alienor come out of the great tent to
take their seats on flower-wreathed chairs before the
principal minstrels, and by their presence give some
decorum to what threatens to become a disgracefully
confused and coarse form of reveling.</p>

<p class="mb2">For a great feast the jongleurs seem, in fact, almost as
indispensable as the cooks. We have now to ask the
nature of North French minstrelsy.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

public feast in the Middle Ages is shown by the following record of
the hospitality dispensed by an archbishop of York, England, in
1466. There is no reason for believing such lavish "feeding of the
multitude" was not fairly common also in France a little earlier.
</p>
<p>
This festival required, by formal record, "300 quarters of wheat,
300 tuns of ale, 100 tuns of wine, 104 oxen, 100 sheep, 304 calves,
304 swine, 400 swans, 2,000 geese, 1,000 capons, 2,000 pigs, 100
dozen quails, 4,000 mallards and teal, 204 cranes, 204 kids, 2,000
ordinary chickens, 4,000 pigeons, and over 500 stags, bucks, and
roes." In addition there were made up "4,000 cold venison pasties,
3,000 dishes of jelly, 4,000 baked tarts, 1,500 hot venison pasties,
2,000 hot custards" and proportionate quantities of spices, sweetened
delicacies, and wafer cakes.
</p>
<p>
Evidently the archbishop was deliberately planning to feast the
entire population of a considerable area of England. Conon's
hospitality herein depicted was, of course, nothing like this.</p></div></div>

<h2>Chapter VIII: The Jongleurs and Secular
Literature and Poetry.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_151.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">T</span>he St. Aliquis folk delight in music. It is
very desirable for a cavalier to have a
rich voice and know how to twang a
harp. Aimery, soon to be Sire Aimery,
can sing and play as well as many minstrels.
Adela spent many hours at her
viol and at a little portable organ before family cares
took up her time. Five or six of the servitors hold their
places mainly because they can play so excellently at
those impromptu dances which
Conon gives on every possible
occasion.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> You cannot linger long
around the castle without hearing
the lutes, the flutes, and the castanets,
and in confining weather in
winter the music keeps up almost
the whole day long.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;"><a id="i_151a"></a>
  <img src="images/i_151a.jpg" width="300" height="268" alt="SMALL PORTABLE ORGAN OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">SMALL PORTABLE ORGAN OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY</p>
<p class="center">From a manuscript in the
Biblioth√®que nationale.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>However, variety is the spice of
life. It is a red-letter day when
a new jongleur or, better still, a
troupe of jongleurs arrive. They
will teach new music, new songs, new tricks to the regular
denizens, and break up that desperate monotony
which sometimes causes the barons to fret with a pent-up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>energy and to precipitate new wars merely to get relief.
As for a great f√™te like the present, obviously a large
corps of entertainers must be mobilized. The mere news
through the region that messire proposed a marriage
feast and a tourney has been enough to start many
such itinerant gentry toward St. Aliquis. Sire Eustace
was overwhelmed with offers of assistance and has had
to chase away some of the would-be entertainers almost
by force.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Varieties of Dances</div>

<p>Jongleurs are versatile people, and each of them has
his specialty. Their name, "jongleur," like "charity,"
covers a multitude of sins. Some of them are merely
expert players upon the viol, and supply music for
dancers. The dances of noble folk are simple: often
enough fair dames and cavaliers merely take hold of one
another's hands and whirl themselves furiously in
a circle, while the music goes faster and faster until the
revelers cease and almost sink of exhaustion. Then there
are variations when the cavaliers decorously drop from
the ring and bow to their ladies; or the "dance of the
chaplet," at the end of which each cavalier ceremoniously
kisses his lady on the cheek&mdash;kissing between equals
being quite proper if it is not on the lips. It takes rather
more skill, as at present, when young Aimery dances an
intricate galliard with the daughter of the Baron of
Bovri. The two performers stand opposite to each other,
advancing, bowing, and retiring, every step made to
music; then at last the cavalier makes his bow to the
lady, takes her by the hand, thanks her, and leads her to
her seat. After that another noble couple dances the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tourdion</i>, a similar performance, but faster and with
more violent action.</p>

<p>For all this competent musicians are indispensable.
But a good jongleur is far more than a musician. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
can dance himself, with intricate acrobatic figures impossible
for the unprofessional; he can sing love songs,
chant or recite romances; and, if he has companions,
even present short farces and comedies. He is probably
possessed also of series of tricks and sleight-of-hand accomplishments,
which appeal more to the groundlings
than do high-flown poetic recitals. If he can reach the
summit of his profession he will be received at castles
almost as the equal of the seigneur, and be able to retire
rich, after having been showered with such gifts as
palfreys, furs, jewels, mantles of red cloth, and, of course,
with much money. Jongleurs recall with pride their
fellow-minstrel Tallefer, who gallantly led the charge of
the Normans at Hastings, trolling the Song of Roland
as he tossed up his sword and caught it again in the
very face of the English, and who fell in the battle only
after making as much havoc among the foe as would a
paladin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Depraved Mountebanks</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_153"></a>

manuscripts in England..</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is a great distance, however, between such pretentious
folk and the run of minstrels. A little while
since a mountebank pair called at St. Aliquis. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
called themselves by grotesque names, "Brise-T√™te" and
"Tue-B&oelig;uf." When they had disposed of a pork pasty,
the seneschal made it plain they had better pay for their
dinner. Thereupon Tue-B&oelig;uf produced a harp, and
Brise-T√™te leaped on the table, flung his arms and legs
about, and showed himself a regular acrobat. After that
his companions set the lads and girls to "ah-ing!" by
swallowing knives and by apparently eating red brands
right out of the fireplace. Next the twain joined in a
witty dialogue presenting a clutching priest wheedling
money out of a miserly burgher; and finally Tue-B&oelig;uf
began telling stories so outrageous that Adela (not
more squeamish than most dames) bade her sister-in-law
to retire. So the two kept the whole hall laughing
through a rainy afternoon, and Conon contented his
entertainers each with a denier.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> They slept on the straw
under the tables and were off early the next morning.
Their repertory was probably exceedingly limited, and
they must have spent their lives wandering from castle
to castle, seldom tarrying anywhere more than a single
night. Other jongleurs have appeared with trick dogs
and monkeys, and who could themselves dance through
hoops, perform such feats as tossing up two small
apples and catching each simultaneously on the point
of a knife held in each hand, or prove themselves
genuine contortionists, as is declared in the old Latin
poem:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He folds himself,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He unfolds himself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in unfolding himself,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He folds himself!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is often a question, indeed, to tell when a jongleur is
really anything more than a roving scoundrel. Certes,
they frequently seem full of thievishness, licentiousness,
and lies. With them are frequently low jongleuresses,
women capable of corrupting a whole monastery. The
Church denounces this entire breed, male and female, as
"ministers of the devil." All the vices which other ages
impute to actors are charged against them, and there is
an old jesting question, "Which would you rather be, a
jongleur or a robber?" Answer: "A robber."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, God knows that people must be amused,
and jongleurs are almost indispensable. Besides, as we
have seen, not all are of this sinful class. The higher
grade of jongleurs sometimes travel in considerable
companies. They bring an orchestra of music&mdash;viols,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
guitars, and gigues&mdash;long, slim, stringed instruments
shaped like a figure eight&mdash;and, of course, including flutes,
harps, and even little portable organs on which you work
the bellows with one hand and press the keys with the
other, something like an accordion. Horns are not
lacking, nor dulcimers, nor cymbals. The Feudal Ages
miss the piano, but otherwise have plenty of sweet-toned
instruments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Superior Type of Jongleur</div>

<p>Each member of such a troupe has his specialty, and
some of the feats are wonderful. There is usually a slim
girl who can perform a "Herodias's daughter's dance"
so magnificently that everybody can understand how the
Palestinian princess took in the gullible king by her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
acrobatic feats. She can even dance on her hands and
kick her feet in the air, to the great delight of all but the
more sanctimonious guests. Vainly did the holy St.
Bernard inveigh against the seigneurs who receive such
troupes in their castles: "A
man fond of jongleurs will
soon possess a wife named
Poverty. The tricks of jongleurs
can never please God."
Certain it is that at the wedding
the bishop and his
priests, after a few <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro forma</i>
coughings, seem laughing as
loudly as do the barons at
all the tricks of Conon's
entertainers.</p>

</div>

<p>A great feast demands
enough jongleurs to entertain
many different circles. While
one bold fellow is keeping
the villeins roaring by the
antics of his tame bear, while
three others (including a
woman) are dancing grossly
upon a platform before other gaping hundreds, a superior
member of their mystery is attracting again many noble
guests to the banqueting tent. He is no common performer.
Messire sent all the way to Chalons for him,
promising ample reward. Ma√Ætre Edmond boasts that
he is a Christian&mdash;meaning he takes his profession as
a kind of lay priesthood. He is on friendly terms with
great prelates. He never recites the scurrilous little
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fabliaux</i> assailing the clergy. He knows by heart, however,
nearly all the great epics and romances. His rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
bliaut of green silk sets forth his impressive figure.
His gestures are eloquent. He can work upon the
imaginations of his audience and move it to tears,
acclamations, or wild excitement. In a later age he
would, in short, be a great actor or an equally great
"reader"&mdash;causing all the parts of a drama to speak
through one person.</p>

<p>Ma√Ætre Edmond has consulted Conon as to what romance
or epic would please the best. There is a great collection
of stories of heroes, usually in a kind of sing-song
verse, and claiming very largely to have a Breton origin.
One whole category revolves around the doings of Charlemagne
and his peers; another deals with King Artus
(Arthur) of Brittany (really Britain) and his Knights of
the Round Table; still another cycle tells of the Trojan
War, and Sire Hector, Sire Achilles, and Sire Ulysses,
making the ancient Ilium into a North French castle
besieged by decidedly feudal methods; while others
rehearse the mighty deeds of Alexander. In all there are
at least forty well-recognized epic <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chansons de geste</i>
(songs of mighty deeds), most of them six thousand to
eight thousand lines in length, besides many shorter
romances. Ma√Ætre Edmond knows a surprising number
of them all. These bald figures give some idea of the
richness of this type of feudal literature.</p>

<p>Of course, the famous "Chanson de Roland" constitutes
the most splendid narrative. Everybody knows the
story of how Roland and Olivier, the favorite peers of
Charlemagne, were betrayed to the Paynim in Spain by
the foul traitor Ganelon; how they sold their lives right
dearly after innumerable doughty deeds; how their
souls ascended to heaven; and how later Charlemagne
took terrific vengeance both on the Infidels and on Ganelon.
It is an epic which in later days will be rated equal, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>not superior, to its German rival, the "Nibelungenlied."
But the "Song of Roland" is now nearly two centuries
old and is very familiar. Besides, it is too long for one
afternoon, and it is hard to pick out episodes. Ma√Ætre
Edmond proposes some scenes from the stories of Troy,
but the baron thinks they are not sufficiently sentimental
for the occasion. So they agree on the "Story of Tristan
and Ysolt." This is fairly well known by the company,
but is not threadbare; it gives plenty of opportunity for
the women to weep, and the jongleur says that he has a
new version not overlengthy.</p>

<p>Ma√Ætre Edmond, therefore, strides out into the bridal
tent, accompanied by a handsome youth in a saffron
mantle, who thrums a harp with silver frets. The high
jongleur begins his story in an easy
recitative which occasionally breaks
into melodious arias. It is really a
mingling of verse and prose, although
the language never loses a certain
meter and rhythm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Story of Tristan and Ysolt</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_158"></a>
  <img src="images/i_158.jpg" width="400" height="490" alt="THIRTEENTH-CENTURY HARP" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">THIRTEENTH-CENTURY HARP</p>
<p class="center">From sculpture in the cathedral of Chartres.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The narrative runs along the
conventional lines:&mdash;King Mark of
Cornwall was a good man and wise
prince. The beautiful Ysolt was
his wife; the valiant and poetic
Tristan his nephew. These last two,
in all innocency, take a magic potion which compels
them to fall in love, and any sinful deeds which follow
are excused by the enchantment. King Mark suffers
for long, trying to forgive, but at last, catching Tristan
playing the lute in the queen's bower, smites him with
a poisoned dart. The unhappy youth, mortally wounded,
takes refuge in the house of his friend Dinas. While
he is still alive, King Mark magnanimously says he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
sorry for his act, while poor Ysolt announces that she
will not survive her lover.</p>

<p>So Tristan sends for his uncle and tells Mark that he
bears him no ill will; while the king (realizing his nephew
is not morally guilty) laments: "Alas, alas! Woe to me for
having stabbed my nephew, the best cavalier in the
whole world!" After that Mark and Ysolt visit Tristan
and make lamentation over his dying state. He presently
causes his sword to be drawn that he may see it for
the last time. "Alas! good sword, what will become of
you henceforth, without your trusty lord. I now take
leave of knighthood, which I have honored. Alas! my
friends, to-day Tristan is vanquished!" Then, with
tears, he bequeathes his sword to his comrade in arms.
Next he turns to the queen. "Very dear lady," he
gasps, "what will you do when I die? Will you not die
with me?" "Gentle friend," says Ysolt, "I call God to
witness that nothing would afford me so much joy as to
bear you company this day. Assuredly, if ever a woman
could die of anguish or sorrow, I should have died already."
"And would you like, then, to die with me?"
asks Tristan. "God knows," replied the queen, "that
never did I desire anything more sincerely." "Approach
me, then," whispers the knight, "for I feel death
coming upon me and I should like to breathe my last
in your arms." Ysolt leans over Tristan, who embraces
her and presses her so tightly that her heart bursts, and
he expires with her, thus mingling their last sighs.</p>

<p>Needless to say, by the time Ma√Ætre Edmond (after
much skillful prolongation and stirring of the feelings)
has finished, all the noble dames are indulging in sobs,
and, indeed, many of the barons blink hard. It is a
delightfully tragic story! Although the minstrel is of too
high a quality to cry "largesse!" when he concludes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
like all the humbler jongleurs, there are many deniers
thrown his way (which the harpist duly gathers), the
duke tells him, "Come to my court at Christmas and
recite the love of Launcelot and Guinevere&mdash;it shall be
worth your while," and Conon orders that a good
Aragonese mule be added to the money payment originally
promised.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Literary Baron</div>

<p>Ma√Ætre Edmond, has, however, another line of business.
His opportunity opens this way. Among Conon's
guests is a baron of Harvengt. This rich seigneur has
spent much time in the south country. He has learned
the gay science of the troubadours. Superior minstrels
are always welcome at his castle; in fact, he is something
of a minstrel himself. Indeed, it is claimed he is too
much interested in matters which are primarily only for
villeins or at best for the women, and neglects his hawks,
tourneys, and even his proper feuds with his neighbors.
Nevertheless, Orri de Harvengt is an extremely "gentle"
man. He possesses a considerable number of books in
Latin&mdash;Virgil, Ovid, Lucan, and others&mdash;although a
visiting monk has grumbled that nearly all the volumes
are by questionable pagans, and that this baron has
almost no parchments of saints' lives and Church fathers.
However, Orri spends little time over the Latin. He holds
that the classical language is best for religious matters,
but that for telling of brave deeds and affairs of the heart
nothing surpasses romance&mdash;the tongue of North France.</p>

<p>A friend of Orri's was Geoffroi de Villehardouin, who
has written in French an excellent history of the Fourth
Crusade, in which he participated; and although the
churchmen complain that "his abandonment of Latin
means the ruin of all learning," the use of the vulgar
tongue for all kinds of books is undoubtedly increasing.</p>

<p>For the less formal kind of writings there is already a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
considerable French literature. Conon himself has a
book of philosophers' proverbs, a collection of wise saws
and maxims that are often attributed to such ancient
worthies as Homer, √Üsop, Moses, and Solomon, but
which have a flavor extremely French. Here you can
find many a saying that will long survive the thirteenth
century, although it is doubtless much more ancient.
"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"; "All is
not gold that glitters"; "God helps those who help
themselves"; "A friend in need is a friend indeed";
"Still waters run deep"&mdash;all are threadbare wisdom
around St. Aliquis, as well as such maxims as do not
transmit so well, such as, "Among the blind, the one-eyed
man is king"; and, "Famine drives the wolf out of
the woods."</p>

<p>But the bulk of this "vulgar" literature is in poetry.
The epics (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chansons</i>) have been growing ever since a
certain Turould is said to have composed the "Song of
Roland" not very long after <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1000. We have just seen
what a wealth of romances Ma√Ætre Edmond has at his
disposal. The earlier of these tales are mere recitals of
war and adventure; but in the later, though they continue
in the North French dialect, the South French
(troubadour) influence appears. We have stories turning
about lawful or illicit love rather than about lance
thrusts. The troubadours of the Langeudoc language
find now compeers in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">trouv√®res</i> of the northern
Languedoil. Baron Orri is a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">trouv√®re</i> himself. He has
tried his hand at making a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chanson</i> on the adventures
of the hero Renaud of Montauban; while composers of
less exalted rank prepare the shorter <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fabliaux</i>, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">contes</i>,
and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dits</i> which abound with comedy and sarcasm,
striking at all the vices and follies of society.</p>

<div class="sidenote">North French Epics and Romances</div>

<p>Baron Orri, however (who is not an original genius),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>is perhaps to be classed really as an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">assembleur</i>&mdash;that
is, he adapts old romances and puts them in a new
setting. He changes over stories from the Languedoc
or from the Breton to his North French dialect. To-day,
at a quiet interval, Ma√Ætre Edmond takes him
aside. "Fair baron, you know that we master jongleurs
seldom wish to set written copies of the poems we chant
before strangers, but how can I deny anything to so
liberal a seigneur as you? I have with me transcripts of
a new song concerning Charlemagne's paladin, William
of Orange, and another prepared by the great <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">trouv√®re</i>,
Robert of Borron, concerning the finding of the Holy
Grail by King Artus's knight, Sire Perceval. Would you
have sight of them?"</p>

<p>Baron Orri is only too pleased. Before he quits St.
Aliquis he will have possessed himself of the precious
parchments, and Ma√Ætre Edmond becomes the richer by
several Paris livres. A fine copy of a great <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chanson</i> is
worth its weight in silver. The monks complain that the
capital letters are as carefully elaborated in gold, and
the miniature illustrations are as delicately executed,
as those in a copy of the Gospel; and that the bindings of
embossed leather make the books so heavy that they
require reading stands, before which the ladies, nevertheless
(neglecting holier things), seem willing to stand
all day long.</p>

<p>However, before the wedding guests end their happy
day, another entertainer than <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Maitre'">Ma√Ætre</ins> Edmond is asked
to perform. It is Baron Orri himself. He has lived so
long in the south country that he has caught the troubadour
gallantries. Stories run that he has left three
lady loves in three different castles; that he has had a
most romantic duel with a jealous husband, which ended
however, in a reconciliation on proof that the friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
had been only platonic; and that he is a past master in
all the thirty-four different methods of rhyming and the
seventy-four different kinds of stanzas with which the
expert bards of southern France serve up their sentimental
ditties. At a suitable moment just before the
noble guests are gathering for the supper Adela addresses
him:</p>

<p>"We know, kind Sire Orri, that you are a practitioner
of all the 'gay science' of the South. You can sing
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chansons</i>, songs of love; <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vers</i>, the poems of slower
movement; <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sirventes</i>, poems of praise or satire; and
also are master of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tenso</i>, the debate on some tender
subject, carried on in courtly verse. Honor us with your
skill; for our northern poetry is rude and uncourtly
beside that of the Languedoc."</p>

<p>Barron Orri makes an elegant bow: "Ah, gracious
lady," he says, "I wish I could convince you that a good
refusal were worth more than a poor gift, but doubtless
you would think me rude; therefore, I will obey. Though
many of you, I fear, do not speak the beautiful Languedoc
tongue, yet in so noble a company I am sure most of
you will at least understand me. What shall it be, a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tenso</i> by Bernart de Ventadorn discussing most wittily,
'How does a lady show the greater affection&mdash;by enjoining
her friend to win renown, or by urging him simply
to love her?' or shall I attempt a short <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chanson</i> by that
other high troubadour, Arnaut de Maruelh?"</p>

<p>"The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chanson</i>&mdash;the love song!" cry the company.</p>

<p>"Ah! very well, my gentle mistresses and lords,"
answers the minstrel&mdash;"you have chosen. And now I
pray Queen Venus to inspire me. Here, boy, my harp!"
He takes a small lute and touches the strings. His blue
mantle floats back in statuesque folds as with clear,
deep voice he sings:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">South French Troubadour Songs</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fair to me is April bearing<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Winds that o'er me softly blow;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>And so through many similar stanzas. The Baron
Orri's eyes are fixed mischievously on a certain countess
with whom he had talked intimately all the afternoon.
Her husband looks somewhat awkward, but at the end
he joins in the warm applause. So the entertainment at
the wedding feast ends; and the great secular literature,
which is to be the priceless heritage of later civilization,
is (despite much crudeness and false sentimentality)
being born.</p>

<h2>Chapter IX: The Feudal Relationship. Doing
Homage.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_165.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">S</span>ome days intervene between the wedding
festivities of the sister of Messire Conon
and the adubbement as knight of his
brother with the tourney which follows
this second ceremony. No baron can be
rich enough to make presents to all the
knights who frequent the tourney, if they were also
guests at the wedding; on the other hand, numerous
cavaliers who have no interest in the affairs of Olivier
and Alienor are glad to come and break lances in the
jousts and to shatter helmets in the m√™l√©e. Most of the
original guests at the wedding, however, stay on for the
adubbement, and are joined by many others. Meantime
there are hunts, hawkings, dances, garden feasts, and
jongleur recitals. It is all one round of merry excitement.
Yet gradually there creeps in a more martial note.
Ma√Ætre Edmond's chants have less to do with parted
lovers and more to do with valiant deeds. The bride and
groom recede from central gaze. Young Squire Aimery is
thrust forward.</p>

<p>While the lists are being prepared for the jousting,
one can examine the public economy of the seigneury;
discover how it is a military as well as a political unit;
and learn the process of education which has enabled
Aimery to claim the proud status of a knight&mdash;a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">miles</i>&mdash;a
first-class fighting man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Types and Privileges of Fief Holders</div>

<p>The status of St. Aliquis is typical of that of many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>baronies. Fiefs are not necessarily composed of real
estate: for example, one of Conon's vassals does homage
to him merely for the right to fish for a mile along the
Claire, and another for the privilege of maintaining the
baronial mill, with corresponding perquisites, in an outlying
section of the seigneury.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Nevertheless, as a rule a
"fief" means a section of land held by a person of noble
family. He does not own this land by complete right,
but pays a kind of rent to his suzerain in the form of
military service, of sums of money in various emergencies
determined upon, and of various other kinds of moral
and material assistance. Ordinarily every feudal lordship
will center round a castle; or, failing that, a fortalice,
a strong tower capable of considerable defense, or a
manor house not vulnerable to mere raiders. Every
noble fief holder claims the right to have his own banner;
to a seal to validate his documents;
and of late there have
been appearing insignia soon to be
known as heraldic coats of arms,
which will be used or displayed
by everybody of "gentle condition."
Many fief holders also
claim the right to coin money,
even when their lands are on a
very modest scale; but suzerains
are gradually curtailing this privilege,
base-born merchants churlishly
complain that the mints of
the lesser seigneurs strike
money too full of alloy and of vexatiously variable
standards; and, indeed, there is even talk that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>privilege of coining is likely to be monopolized by the
king.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 235px;"><a id="i_167"></a>

</div>

<p>Feudalism, if systematized, would seem an admirably
articulated system, extending upward from the petty
nobles to the king or even the emperor.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The little castellans
would do homage to the barons,
they to the viscounts, they to the
counts, they to the dukes, and they
to the supreme suzerain, His Grace
Philip Augustus, at Paris. Actually,
of course, nothing of the kind occurs.
Not merely do many fief
holders have several suzerains (as
does Conon) and serve some of
them very poorly, but there is no
real gradation of feudal titles.
Conon, a baron, feels himself equal
to many counts and superior to most viscounts. The
mighty Count of Champagne holds his head arrogantly
as the equal of the Duke of Burgundy. Of
late years, especially since Philip Augustus began to
reign (1180), the kings of France have made it clear
that they are the mightiest of the mighty, and deserve
genuine obedience. Yet even now many seigneurs
grumble, "These lords of Paris are only the
Capetian dukes who began to call themselves kings
some two hundred years ago. Let them wax not too
proud or we will send them about their business
as our forefathers sent the old <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Carrolingians'">Carolingians</ins>." In
short, the whole feudal arrangement is utterly confused.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>"Organized anarchy," despairing scholars of a later

<div class="sidenote">Duties of Fief Holders</div>

<p>Yet there are some pretty definite rules about fief
holding. Generally speaking a fief includes enough land
to maintain at least one knight and his war horse. This
warrior is obligated usually
to lead out a number of
armed villeins, proportionate
to the number of knights.
The conditions on which the
estate can be held vary
infinitely. The great obligation
is military service.
The average vassal is bound
to follow his suzerain for
forty days per year on summons
to an offensive war. He
is required to give much
greater assistance in a strictly defensive war, and especially
to aid in the defense of his lord's castle. He has to
wait on the suzerain at times, when the latter may desire
a great retinue to give prestige to his court. At such
gatherings he must likewise assist his lord in dispensing
justice&mdash;a matter sometimes involving considerable responsibility
for the judges. When his seigneur marries off
his eldest daughter, bestows knighthood on his eldest son,
or needs ransom money, if held a prisoner, the vassals
must contribute, and the St. Aliquis fief holders are
blessing their patron saints that Alienor and Aimery
are not their overlord's children&mdash;otherwise they would
pay for most of the high festivities themselves. They
must also, when their lord visits them, give him proper
hospitality in their castles. Of course, they must never
betray his secrets, adhere to his enemies, or repudiate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
the pledges made to him. To do so were "treason,"
the worst of all feudal crimes.</p>

<p>We have seen that holding a fief usually implies military
service, and that if the estate falls to a woman the
suzerain can administer the property until the maid is of
marriageable age, and then give her to some competent
liegeman. It is about the same if the heir is a boy. The
overlord can exercise guardianship over the fief until the
lad is old enough to lead out his war band and otherwise
to prove a desirable vassal. Even when the vassals are
of satisfactory sex and age, the suzerain is entitled to a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">relief</i>, a money payment, whenever an old knight dies
and his battle-worthy son takes over the barony.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> This
is always a fairly heavy lump sum; and is still heavier
if the fief goes not to the son, but to a collateral heir.
Also, when the vassal wants to sell his fief to some
stranger, not merely must the suzerain approve the
change, but he is entitled to an extra large fee, often as
much as three years' revenue from the entire holding.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when all is said, many fief holders act as
if they were anything but humble vassals. Happy is many
a suzerain when he is so exempt from squabbles with his
feudal equals and his own overlord that he can compel his
loyal lieges to execute all their promises, and when he can
indulge in the luxury of dictating to them the manner
whereby they must rule their lands. Some of the mottoes
of the great baronial houses testify how little the feudal
hierarchy counts with the lord of a few strong castles.</p>

<p>Boast the mighty Rohans:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dukes we disdain:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Kings we can't be:<br /></span>
<span class="i1"><em>Rohans</em> are we!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>
<p>And still more arrogant is that of a seigneur whose
magnificent fortress-ch√¢teau is in the process of erection;
"No king am I, no prince, no duke: I'm just the Sire of
Coucy." And to be "Sire of Coucy" means to dispose
of such power that when the canons of Rheims complain
to King Philip against his deeds of violence, the
king can merely reply, "I can do no more for you than
<em>pray</em> the Sire of Coucy to leave you unmolested."</p>

<p>Sometimes, in addition to money payments or personal
or military service, a vassal is required to make symbolic
gifts in token of loyal intentions. Thus annually
Conon sends to the Duke of Quelqueparte three black
horses; while for his holdings of the local abbey, every
June he presents the abbot with a basket of roses and a
bunch of lilies, and many other estates are burdened with
some such peculiar duties.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Barons Largely Independent</div>

<p>So long as he discharges his feudal obligations a seigneur
can run his barony practically to suit himself. If
he treats his own vassals and his peasants too outrageously
they may cry out to the suzerain for justice,
and sometimes the overlord will delight in an excuse to
humble an arrogant feudatory. But the limits of interference
are well marked. No seigneur should undermine
a faithful vassal's hold on his own subjects. Every
noble will feel his own rights threatened if a suzerain
begins to meddle with a dependent, even if the reason for
doing so is manifest. Many a baron can therefore play
the outrageous tyrant if so the devil inspires him. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>has (as we have seen) to observe the vested rights of his
subordinates on the fief; otherwise he may provoke a
dangerous mutiny within his own castle.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Baron Garnier
of St. Aliquis, however, has been typical of many of his
class. Prisoners, travelers, peasants are subject to
unspeakably brutal treatment. As has been written
concerning one such seigneur: "He was a very Pluto,
Meg√¶ra, Cerberus, or anything you can conceive still
more horrible. He preferred the slaughter of his captives
to their ransom. He tore out the eyes of his own
children, when in sport they hid their faces under his
cloak. He impaled persons of both sexes on stakes. To
butcher men in the most horrible manner was to him an
agreeable feast." Of another such baron, the trembling
monks record: "When anyone by force or fraud fell into
his hands, the captive might truly say, 'The pains of hell
have compassed me about.' Homicide was his passion
and glory. He treated his wife in an unspeakably
brutal manner. Men feared him, bowed down to him and
worshiped him!"<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Types of Evil and Good Barons</div>

<p>Evidently, such outrageous seigneurs hold their lieges
in a kind of fascinated obedience, just as do the emirs
and atabegs among the Infidels. Of course, they treat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
merchants as merely so many objects for plunder. If
they do not watch the roads themselves, they make
bargains with professional robbers, allowing the latter
to infest their seigneuries in return for an agreed share
of their booty. Even noble folk are liable to be seized,
imprisoned, and perhaps tortured to get a ransom. If
you cannot find the deniers, you may leave your bones in
a foul dungeon.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, St. Michael and all angels be praised!
this evil is abating. In the direct royal dominions such
"men of sin" have been rooted out since old Louis VI's
time. The Church is using its great influence against
evil sires. The communal towns are waxing strong and
sending civic armies to besiege their towers and protect
the roads. The better class of seigneurs also unite
against these disgraces to nobility. As for Baron
Garnier, he died betimes, for his <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'suzerian'">suzerain</ins> the duke
(weary of complaints) was about to call out the levy of
the duchy and attack St. Aliquis. In other words, law
and order are gradually asserting themselves after the
heyday of petty tyrannies, yet there are still queersome
happenings on every seigneury, and the amount of
arbitrary power possessed by the average baron is not
good even for a conscientious and high-minded man.</p>

<p>It is not the theoretical powers of a seigneur, but his
actual mental and ofttimes physical ability, which determines
the real extent of his power. Fiefs are anything
but static. They are always growing or diminishing.
A capable seigneur is always attracting new lands to
himself. He ejects unfaithful vassals and adds their
estates to his own personal domain land. He induces his
vassal's vassals to transfer their allegiance directly to
him. He wins land from his neighbors by direct conquest.
He induces his neighbor's vassals to desert to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
the better protection of his suzerainty. He negotiates
advantageous marriage treaties for his relatives which
bring new baronies into his dynasty. When his own
suzerain needs his military aid beyond the orthodox
"forty days," he sells his assistance for cash, lands, or
valuable privileges.</p>

<p>Then, often when such an aggressive seigneur dies, his
whole pretentious fief crumbles rapidly. His eldest son
is entitled to the central castle, and the lion's share of
the barony, but not to the whole. The younger lads each
detach something, and the daughters cannot be denied
a portion.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The suzerain presses all kinds of demands
upon the weakened heir. So do neighboring seigneurs
who are the new baron's feudal equals. One little
quarrel after another has to be compounded after
ruinous concessions. Worst of all, the direct vassals of
the incoming baron refuse him homage, hunt up more
congenial suzerains, or, if swearing fealty, nevertheless
commit perjury by the treacherous way they execute
their oaths. In a few years what has appeared a powerful
fief, under a young or incapable baron seems on the
very edge of ruin&mdash;its lord reduced to a single castle, with
perhaps some question whether he can defend even that.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Accession to a Barony</div>

<p>Through such a peril Conon passed inevitably when,
as a very youthful knight, he took over the estates of
his unblessed uncle. Only the saints' favor, his mother's
wise counsels, and his own high looks and strong arm
kept the fief together. But after the vassal petty nobles
had been duly impressed with the fact that, even if the
new baron were less of a bloody tyrant than his predecessor,
he could storm a defiant fortalice and behead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>its rebellious master, the barony settled down to relative
peace. There was a meeting at St. Aliquis of all the
vassals. Conon, clothed in full armor, then presented
himself in the great hall.</p>

<p>"Will you have Sire Conon, the nephew of your late
lord, as your present undoubted baron and suzerain?"
demanded Sire Eustace, the seneschal.</p>

<p>"<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Fiat! Fiat!</i>&mdash;So be it!" shouted all the knights.
Whereat each in turn did homage; and Conon was now
their liege lord by every Christian and feudal law. Next
Conon himself visited the Duke of Quelqueparte, paid
his relief, in turn did his own homage; and henceforth
had his position completely recognized.</p>

<p>From that time Conon had been obeyed by his vassals
with reasonable fidelity. They had never refused
military service; they had fought round his standard
very faithfully at the great battle of Bouvines; they had
given him no reason to doubt that if he were hard bestead
they would discharge the other feudal duties of defending
his person at the hazard of their lives, of resigning a
horse to him that he might save himself in a battle, or
even of going prisoner for him to secure his release, if he
were captive. On the other hand, Conon had earned
their love by proving himself a very honorable seigneur.
When his vassal, Sire Leonard, had died, leaving only a
minor son, he administered the lad's fief very wisely and
gave it back a little richer, if anything, when the heir
came of age. When another vassal had fallen into a
feud with a neighboring sire, Conon had afforded military
help, although it was not his direct quarrel. He had
respected the wives and daughters of his petty nobles as
though they had been his sisters. In short, on St.
Aliquis had been almost realized that happy relation
mentioned in the law books, "The seigneur owes faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
and loyalty to his 'man' as much as the man to his
seigneur."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Conon ("wise as a serpent, but <em>not</em>
harmless as a dove," as Father <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Gr√©gorie'">Gr√©goire</ins> says, pithily)
takes nothing for granted. Twice he has somewhat
formally made the circuit of his seigneury, stopping at
each castle, allowing each little sire to show hospitality,
and then receiving again his pledges. Homage can be
done many times. The more often it is repeated the
more likely it will be effective.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Your vassal who swore
fealty last Christmas is much more likely to obey the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ban</i> (the call to arms) than he who took his oath ten
years ago. The St. Aliquis vassals have all performed
this devoir quite recently, save one, Sire Andr√© of the
sizable castle of Le Chenevert, whose father died last
Lent, and who has waited for the present f√™tes to take
his vows and receive due investiture.</p>

<p>This ceremony, therefore, takes place some day after
the wedding feast. There is nothing humiliating therein
for Sire Andr√©; on the contrary, he is glad to have many
of the noble guests be witnesses&mdash;they will serve to confirm
his title to his father's fief.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ceremony of Homage</div>

<p>The great hall has been cleared. Messire Conon sits
in his high chair under the canopy. He wears his ermine
and his velvet cap of presence. Adela sits at his side,
with many cavaliers on either hand. The other St.
Aliquis vassals and the noble leaders of the castle men at
arms, all in best armor, stand before the dais in a semicircle.
Sire Eustace holds a lance with a small red
pennon. Sire Andr√©, in silvered mail and helmet and
his sword girded, comes forward, steps up to the dais,
and kneels. Conon rises, extends both hands, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>Andr√© takes one in each of his, then repeats clearly the
formula dictated by Father Gr√©goire, now, as so often,
acting as baronial chancellor:</p>

<p>"Sire baron, <i>I enter into your homage and faith
and become your man</i>, by mouth and hands, and I
swear and promise to keep faith and loyalty to you
against all others, saving only the just rights of the
Baron of Braisne, from whom I hold two farms and
certain hunting rights, and I swear to guard your rights
with all my strength."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_176"></a>
  <img src="images/i_176.jpg" width="400" height="270" alt="HOMAGE IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">HOMAGE IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY</p>
<p class="center">The future vassal has put his hands in those of his lord and pays him homage; a soldier holds the lance which the lord
will give to his subject as a mark of investiture in the domain.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Whereupon Conon makes reply, "We do promise to
you, vassal Andr√©, that we and our heirs will guarantee
to you the lands held of us, to you and your heirs against
every creature with all our power, to hold these lands
in peace and quiet."</p>

<p>Conon then bends, kisses Andr√© upon the mouth, and
the latter rises to his feet. Father Gr√©goire holds out a
small golden box flashing with jewels, a saint's reliquary.
The vassal puts his right hand upon it and declares:</p>

<p>"In the name of the Holy Trinity, and in reverence of
these sacred relics, I, Andr√©, swear that I will truly keep
the promise which I have taken, and will always remain
faithful to Sire Conon, my seigneur."</p>

<p>The first formula has technically been the "homage."
The second is the "oath of fealty"; now comes the "investiture."
Sire Eustace steps forward and gives to the
vassal the lance, the symbolic token of the lawful transfer
to him of the fief. In other places, local custom would
make the article a glove, a baton, or even a bit of straw,
but some symbol is always required. This act completes
the ceremony.</p>

<p>Sire Andr√© is now in possession of Le Chenevert and
its lands, and cannot be ousted thence so long as he
performs his feudal duties. Of course, if the fief had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
been granted out for the first time, or had been transferred
to some one not a direct heir, there would be a
deed of conveyance drafted in detail, and sealed by many
ponderous lumps of wax attached to the parchment with
strips of leather. In many cases however, no new document
is needful, and, indeed, all through the Feudal
Ages even important bargains are likely often to be
determined merely by word of mouth&mdash;a reason for
requiring many witnesses.</p>

<p class="mb2">There is little danger, however, of a quarrel between
such congenial spirits as Baron Conon and Sire Andr√©.
At its best, vassalship is not a state of unworthy dependence;
it is a state of junior comradeship which,
"without effacing distances, created a close relation of
mutual devotion"; and if vassals are often rebellious,
vassals again and again in history and in story have
proved willing to lay down their lives for their lord.
There are few sentiments the jongleurs can repeat in the
average castle with surer hope of applause than when they
recite once more from the "Epic of Garin," concerning
the Duke of Belin, who declared that there was something
more precious than all his riches and power;
for "wealth consists neither in rich clothes, nor in
money, nor in buildings, nor in horses, but is made
from kinsmen and <em>friends</em>; the heart of one man is
worth all the gold in a country!"</p>

<h2>Chapter X: Justice and Punishments.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_180.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">O</span>ne of the great duties of a high seigneur
is to render justice. It is for that (say
learned men) that God grants to him
power over thousands of villeins and
the right to obedience from nobles of the
lower class. Indeed, it can be written
most properly that a good baron "is bound to hear and
determine the cause and pleas of his subjects, to ordain
to every man his own, to put forth his shield of righteousness
to defend the innocent against evildoers, and
deliver small children and such as be orphans and
widows from those that do overset them. He pursues
robbers, raiders, thieves, and other evildoers. For this
name 'lord' is a name of peace and surety. For a
good lord ceaseth war, battle, and fighting, and reconciles
men that are at strife. And so under a
good, strong, and peaceable lord, men of the country
are safe."</p>

<p>The best of barons only measurably live up to this
high standard. Yet Conon is not wholly exceptional
in telling himself that a reputation for enforcing justice
is in the end a surer glory than all the f√™tes around
St. Aliquis.</p>

<p>Justice, of course, does not mean equality before the
law. There is one legal measure for country villeins,
another for citizens of the commune, another for petty
nobles, another for greater nobles of Conon's own rank.
The monks and priests can always "plead their clergy"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
and get their cases transferred to a special Church
tribunal.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The question really is: Has a man been given
everything due to others of his own class? If not, there
is denial of justice.</p>

<p>The laws enforced in the St. Aliquis region are the old
customary laws in use ever since the Frankish barbarians'
invasions. Many of these laws have never been
reduced to writing&mdash;at least for local purposes&mdash;but sage
men know them. There are no professional jurists in
the barony. Sire Eustace, the seneschal, understands the
regional law better than any other layman around the
castle, though he in turn is surpassed by Father Gr√©goire.
The latter has, indeed, a certain knowledge of the Canon
law of the Church, far more elaborate than any local
territorial system, and he has even turned over voluminous
parchments of the old Roman law codified by the
mighty Emperor Justinian. Up at Paris, round the
king there are now trained lawyers, splitters of fine hairs,
who say that this Roman law is far more desirable than
any local "customary law," and they are even endeavoring
(as the king extends his power) to make the Code of
Justinian the basis for the entire law of France. But
conditions on most baronies are still pretty simple, the
questions to be settled call merely for common sense and
a real love of fair play on the part of the judges. One
can live prosperously and die piously under rough-and-ready
laws administered with great informality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">High and Low Justice</div>

<p>Conon has "high justice" over his vassals and peasants.
This means absolute power of life and death over any
non-noble on the seigneury, unless, indeed, the baron
should outrage merchants bound to a privileged free
city, or some other wayfarers under the specific protection
of the king or the Duke of Quelqueparte. If strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>noblemen get into trouble, it will depend on circumstances
whether Conon undertakes to handle their cases himself,
or refers them to his suzerain, the duke. The right of
seigneurs to powers of justice on their own lands even
over high nobles is, however, tenaciously affirmed, and
it is only with difficulty the duke and, above him, the
king can get some cases remitted to their tribunals.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> If,
however, the alleged offender is a monk, he will be
handed over to the local abbot or, if a priest, to the
bishop of Pontdebois to be dealt with according to the
law of the Church.</p>

<p>Even the lesser sires have "low justice," with the
privilege of clapping villeins in the stocks, flogging, and
imprisoning for a considerable time for minor offenses;
and robbers caught on their lands in the act of crime can
be executed summarily. But serious cases have to go
to the court of the baron as high justiciar, as well as all
the petty cases which have arisen on that lord's personal
dominions. If the litigants are peasants, the wheels of
justice move very rapidly. There is a decided absence
of formalities.</p>

<p>A great many disputes go before the provost's court,
presided over by Sire Macaire, a knight of the least
exalted class, who is Conon's "first provost." We shall
see later how the baron's provosts practically control
the life of the peasants.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> One of Sire Macaire's main
duties is to chase down offenders, acting as a kind of
sheriff, and after that to try them. Among the brawling,
brutal peasantry there is always a deplorable amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
of crime. The seigneury has been blessed with a
comparative absence of bandits, but ever and anon a
Pontdebois merchant gets stripped, a girl is carried off
into the woods, or even the body of a traveler is found
by the roadside. All this renders Sire Macaire's office
no sinecure.</p>

<p>Small penalties are handed down every day, but more
serious matters must wait for those intervals when
Messire Conon calls his noble vassals to his "plaids"
or "assizes." Every fief holder is expected to come and
to give his lord good counsel as to what ought to be
done, especially if any of the litigants are noble, and also
to give him material aid, if needs be, in executing the
decision reached.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> This last is very important, for if a
fief holder is dissatisfied with a verdict, he has a technical
right to declare the decision "unjust" and demand that
it be settled by "ordeal of battle"&mdash;the duel not being
between the defeated suitor and his adversary, but
between this suitor and his judge!</p>

<p>All men know of what happened (according to the
"Song of Roland") in the case of the traitor Ganelon.
This scoundrel, who had betrayed his suzerain Charlemagne
and had caused the brave Roland's death, was
seized by the emperor, but he demanded "judgment by
his peers." Charlemagne could not deny this claim.
He convoked the high barons, whereupon Lord Pinabel,
Ganelon's kinsman, announced that "he would give the
lie with the sword" to any seigneur who voted for
punishment. All the barons were afraid. Pinabel was
a mighty warrior. They reported an acquittal to Charlemagne.
The mighty emperor raged, but felt helpless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
until he discovered the brave knight Thierry of Anjou,
who boldly asserted that "Ganelon deserves death."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ordeal by Battle</div>

<p>Instantly Pinabel strode forward and cried to the
assize of nobles: "I say that Thierry has lied. I will
fight!" and at once Charlemagne took pledges from both
champions that they would stand the "ordeal." Each
warrior then promptly went to mass, partook of the
Sacrament, and bestowed great gifts on the monasteries.
Next they met in mortal combat. After a desperate
duel Thierry smote his foe "through the nasal of the
helmet ... and therewith the brain of Pinabel went
gushing from his head." There was no appeal from that
verdict! Well content, Charlemagne immediately caused
Ganelon to be pulled asunder by four fierce stallions.</p>

<p>However, these noble usages are falling into decadence.
Certes, it is an unknightly thing when both
litigants are young cavaliers, evenly matched, and when
the issue concerns honor rather than legal technicalities,
for them to insist that the matter be settled merely by a
peaceful verdict, as if they had been wrangling merchants.
But the Church, the men of books, and the higher
suzerains discourage this practice, especially when the
cases are intricate, and one of the litigants cannot fight
efficiently or provide a champion. As for challenging a
judge after a disagreeable verdict, the thing is becoming
dangerous, for all the other judges will feel bound to
support him.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The most likely happening is for the defeated litigant
to retire to his castle, summon his followers, and defy the
court to enforce its verdict. This happened with a sire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>of the Court of Trabey, a neighbor of Conon's. Said
sire, having been ordered by his peers to give up a manor
he had been withholding from his young nephew, sent a
pursuivant before their tribunal formally declaring war.
The entire seigneury had to arm and actually storm
his castle before he would submit.</p>

<p>However, most St. Aliquis cases concern not the nobles,
but only villeins, and with these (thanks be to Heaven!)
short shrifts are permitted. The provost can handle the
run of crimes when the baron is busy; but a good
seigneur acts as his own judge if possible. Even during
the festival period it is needful for Conon to put aside
his pleasures one morning to mount the seat of justice.
In wintertime the tribunal is, of course, in the great hall,
but in such glorious weather a big shade tree in the
garden is far preferable.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Here the baron occupies a
high chair. Sire Eustace sits on a stool at his right,
Sire Andr√© and another vassal at his left as "assessors,"
for no wise lord acts without council. Father Gr√©goire
stands near by, ready to administer oaths on the box of
relics; Sire Macaire, the provost, brings up the litigants
and acts as a kind of state attorney.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Trial of Villeins</div>

<p>For the most part it is a sordid, commonplace business.
Two villeins dispute the ownership of a yoke of oxen.
A peddler from Pontdebois demands payment from a
well-to-do farmer for some linen. An old man is resisting
the demands of his eldest son that he be put under
guardianship: the younger children say that their
brother really covets the farm. If the court's decisions
are not so wise as Solomon's, they are speedy and probably
represent substantial justice. But there is more
serious business in hand. The news of the f√™tes at St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Aliquis has been bruited abroad. All the evil spirits of
the region have discovered their chance. Certain discharged
mercenary soldiers have actually invaded a
village, stolen the peasants' corn, pigs, and chickens,
insulted their women, and crowned their deeds by firing
many cottages and setting upon three jongleurs bound
for the tourney. They were in the very act of robbing
them to their skin when a party of the provost's men,
coming up, managed to seize two of these sturdy rascals.
Sire Macaire has also arrested a young peasant who
stabbed an older farmer painfully while they wrangled
over a calf.</p>

<p>This second case is settled summarily. The defendant
is of bad reputation. He must stand all day in the
pillory, and then to be branded on his forehead with
a red-hot iron, that all men may beware of him. As for
the alleged bandits, the case is not so simple. They
keep a sullen silence and refuse to betray the lair of their
comrades who have escaped. The provost intimates
that they may be <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">halegrins</i>, and outlaws of the foulest
type, said to violate tombs and devour human flesh.
Very possibly they may have belonged to that notorious
gang of brigands many of which King Philip lured inside
the walls of Bourges, then closed the gates and slew them,
thus capturing all their plunder. Such fellows are, of
course, food for the crows, but they must not be allowed
to get out of life too easily.</p>

<p>"Let the baron command preparatory torture?" suggests
Sire Macaire, with a sinister smile. Conon nods.
The two beastlike wretches groan and strain at their
fetters. Preparatory torture, they know well, is inflicted
both to get a confession of guilt and also to extort
details about accomplices.</p>

<p>It is no pleasure to follow the provost, his guards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
and his prisoners to a certain tower, where in a lower
vaulted room there are various iron and wooden instruments.
We are given to understand that torture is a
pretty usual part of criminal proceedings, unless the
defendant is a noble whose alleged crime does not touch
the safety of the state. It is true that wise men have
discouraged the practice. What seems clearer than that
which Pope Nicholas I wrote <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 866? "A confession
must be voluntary and not forced. By means of torture
an innocent man may suffer to the uttermost without
making any avowal&mdash;in such a case what a crime for
the judge! Or a person may be subdued by pain, and
acknowledge himself guilty, though he be innocent&mdash;which
throws an equally great sin upon the tribunal."
Nevertheless, the Church is said now to be allowing
torture in her own ecclesiastical courts, and Sire Macaire
would tell us cynically that "torture is a sovereign
means wherewith to work miracles&mdash;to make the dumb
speak."</p>

<p>Torture at St. Aliquis is administered by a sober-faced
man in a curious yellow dress. He is known as Ma√Ætre
Denis,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> the baron's "sworn executioner." He acts as
torturer, chief jailer, and also attends to beheadings and
hangings. To be a professional hangman implies considerable
ostracism. Hangmen's families have to marry
among themselves, between fief and fief; hangmen's
sons follow their fathers' calling. On the other hand, the
position is an assured one, with good perquisites and
not too much labor. Ma√Ætre Denis is a quiet and pious
man, who can exhort condemned criminals quite as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
sanctimoniously as a priest; but his piety never compels
him to false mercy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Varieties of Tortures</div>

<p>There are assuredly many ways of helping transgressors
to make a complete confession. Forms of
torture vary from region to region. In Brittany the
culprit is often tied in an iron chair and gradually
brought near to a blazing fire; but in Normandy the
effect seems best when one thumb is squeezed by a
kind of screw in the ordinary, and both thumbs in the
extraordinary (doubly severe) torture. At Autun they
have an ingenious method. After high boots of spongy
leather have been put on the culprit's feet, he is tied
near a large fire and boiling water is poured on the boots,
which penetrates the leather, eats away the flesh, and
vouchsafes a foretaste of the pangs of hell.</p>

<p>At Orl√©ans they have another method. The accused's
hands are tied behind his back, and a ring fastened to
them. By this ring the unhappy fellow is lifted from the
floor and hung up in midair. If they then desire the
"extraordinary" torture, weights of some two hundred
and fifty pounds are attached to his feet. He is hoisted
to the ceiling by a pulley, and presently allowed to fall
with a jerk, dislocating his limbs.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>There are, indeed, many simpler, more convenient
methods of torture. You can inject boiling water,
vinegar, or oil into the accused, apply hot pitch, place
hot eggs under the armpits, thrust sharp-cornered dice
between the skin and flesh, tie lighted candles to the
hands so that they can be consumed simultaneously
with the wax, or allow water to drip from a great height
upon the stomach. This, curiously enough, is said to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>break down the most stubborn criminals, as will watering
the soles of the feet with salted water, and allowing
goats to lick the same.</p>

<p>However, the ordinary method is the rack. Then
the offender is laid on a wooden trestle, cords are bound
to his limbs and then steadily tightened with winches.
Baron Garnier in his day took great interest in obtaining
a well-made rack. It now is put to proper use in "stretching"
the two brigands. Happily, these culprits break
down after the first of them has undergone a few turns
before his limbs are dislocated; and to the provost's
satisfaction they howl out sundry details as to how
their comrades can be taken. The prisoners are therefore
remanded to custody until their statements can
be investigated. Woe to them if they have lied! In
that event there are promised them much keener tortures
to make them weary of life.</p>

<p>While Sire Macaire is therefore leading his band after
the remaining brigands, Ma√Ætre Denis conducts the two
captives back to prison. Really it is only a few feet from
the great hall of state in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">palais</i>, to the cells under
the old donjon. In their confinement the prisoners can
hear the revelry of the baron's guests. Through their
airholes drifts the jongleur's music. They can almost,
at times, catch the swish and rustle of the rich dresses
of the noblewomen. Conon is accounted a merciful
custodian compared with his uncle, but he does not
let offenders forget their sins because of kindness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prisoners and Dungeons</div>

<p>Noble prisoners are entitled to relatively comfortable
quarters, to double rations of decent food, to give bail
if their alleged offense is not a very heavy one, and to be
released on reasonable ransom if they are captives of war.
Villeins have no such privileges. They are fortunate if
first they are not stripped naked as a pair of tongs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
before the lock rattles behind them. They are usually
cast into filthy holes, sometimes with water running
across the floor, and with reptiles breeding in the mire. In
Paris, where the king is considered more tender-hearted
than the average seigneur, we hear of a cell of only eleven
by seven feet in which ten people have been thrust to
spend the night. Of course, these were not great criminals.
The latter might enjoy the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chausse d' hypocras</i>,
where a man had his feet continually in water, or the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fosse</i>, a jug-shaped round chamber let into the bowels
of the rock, into which prisoners must be lowered by a
pulley from the ceiling;<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> or a Little-Ease chamber, where
one could neither sit nor stand. If, however, you have
money you can sometimes bribe the turnkeys into
letting you have a cell more private and less noisome,
with the luxury of bedding and a chair;<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> but in any case
he who enters a feudal prison had better invoke his patron
saint.</p>

<p>Ma√Ætre Denis has not treated the two brigands quite
so badly as lay in his power. He has left them their
clothes&mdash;since they are sure to be executed and he can
get the raiment later. He has not put them in the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fosse</i> (where Baron Garnier had sometimes dropped
his victims) because of the trouble later of hoisting them
out. He gives them coarse bread and some meat not
unfit for dogs, at the same time advising them "on his
word as a Christian" to confer with Father Gr√©goire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>The miserable pair are not long uncertain about
their fate. They have told the truth about the lair of
their comrades. The provost's band surprises the spot.
Six hardened rogues, in the very act of counting their
plunder, are overpowered. But why weary Messire
the Baron with the empty form of trying these robbers
when there is no mortal doubt of their guilt and no new
information is to be extracted from them? Their throats
are therefore cut as unceremoniously as the cook's boy
attends to pigeons. The next day, wholly casually,
Sire Macaire reports his good success to his lord, and
remarks, "I presume, fair Sire, that Denis can hang the
two he has in the dungeon." Conon (just arranging a
hawking party) rejoins: "As soon as the chaplain can
shrive them." Why, again, should the prisoners complain?
They are certainly allowed to prepare decently
for the next world, a favor entirely denied their comrades.</p>

<p>If there had been any real doubt as to the guilt of the
two bandits, they might in desperation have tried to
clear themselves by <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ordeal</i>. If they could have picked
a stone out of a caldron of boiling water, lifted and
carried a red-hot iron, or even partaken of the Holy
Sacrament (first calling on God to strike them dead if
they were guilty), and after such a test seemed none the
worse, they might have had some claim to go free.
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ordeals</i> are an old Germanic usage. They seem to refer
the decision to all-seeing God. But ever since Charlemagne's
day they have been falling into disfavor. Great
churchmen are ordinarily too intelligent to encourage
them. Men learned in the law say that often they wrest
justice. Brave knights declare the only ordeal worth
having is a duel between two champions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ordeals, the Pillory and Flogging</div>

<p>Sometimes, instead of wrangling, clerics have undertaken
to prove themselves right by "passing through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
fire"&mdash;walking down a narrow lane between two great
piles of blazing fagots, and trusting that Heaven will
guard them even as it did the three Hebrew children in
Nebuchadnezzar's furnace. Such tests seldom are satisfactory.
Men still dispute about the ordeal of the monk
Peter Barthelmey during the First Crusade. He was
accused of a pretended miracle and tried to vindicate himself
by "passing through fire alive." All agreed that he
emerged from the flames alive; yet in a few days he
died. His foes said because he was sorely burned; his
friends because, although unscathed by the fire, he was
merely trampled upon by the crowd that rushed up to
discover his fate!</p>

<p>The only time one can ordinarily rely upon ordeals is
in tests for witchcraft. If an old woman is so accused,
she must be tied hand and foot and cast into the river.
If she floats, the devil is aiding; draw her out, therefore,
and burn her at the stake. If she sinks (as in a case
recently at Pontdebois) she is innocent. Unfortunately,
in this instance the poor wretch went to the bottom
before they could determine that she was guiltless; but
the saints know their own, and doubtless they have
given recompense and rest to her soul.</p>

<p>Naturally many petty offenses do not deserve death.
The criminals are usually too poor to pay fines, and it is
a waste of honest folk's bread to let them spend set
terms in prison. For small misdemeanants it is often
enough to drive the rascals around the neighboring
villages in a cart, calling out their names amid hootings
and showers of offal. But in the village beyond
the Claire is located the pillory for a large class of rogues.
It is a kind of high scaffold with several sets of chains and
wooden collars, through which the offenders' arms and
heads are thrust, while they stand for hours, in hot sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
or winter cold, exposed to the jeerings and pebbles of
the assembled idlers gathered beneath.</p>

<p>The next stage of penalty is sometimes a public
flogging. The prisoner is stripped to the waist and
driven around the seigneury. At each crossroads his
guards give so many blows over the shoulders with a
knotted rope. We have seen how branding was ordered
for one young miscreant to put on him an ineffaceable
stigma; and not infrequently one can meet both men
and women with a hand lopped off, or even an eye
gouged out, as a merciful substitute for their true deserts
upon the gallows. Old Baron Garnier once, when
peculiarly incensed, ordered the "hot bowl"&mdash;namely,
that a red-hot brazier should be passed before the eyes
of his victim until sight was destroyed.</p>

<p>But if a villein has committed a great crime he were
best dismissed from an overtroubled world. Dead men
never bother the provost twice. All over France you
will find a gallows almost as common a sight in the
landscape as a castle, an abbey, or a village. Many a
fine spreading tree by the roadway has a skeleton be-dangling
from one of its limbs. It is a lucky family of
peasants which has not had some member thereof
hanged, and even then plenty of rogues will die in their
beds. Considering the general wickedness abroad, it
seems as if there were a perpetual race between the
criminals and the hangmen, with the criminals well to
the fore.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Public Gallows</div>

<p>There are almost as many forms of execution as there
are of torture. Fearful criminals, gross blasphemers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
and the like might be killed by quartering: first their
flesh might be nipped off by red-hot pinchers and hot
lead poured into their wounds; then death comes as a
release by attaching a strong horse to each arm and leg
and tearing the victim into four parts. Witches, wizards,
and heretics are, of course, burned, because they thus
share the element of their patron, the devil. Most
malefactors, however, find beheading or hanging the
ordinary ending.</p>

<p>Beheading is "honorable." It is the nobleman's
expiation for misdeeds. The victim is not degraded and
leaves no stigma upon his children. In England the
headsman uses the ax, but in France he ordinarily swings
a great two-handed sword. A skillful executioner does
his business at one blow&mdash;a most merciful form of
mortal exit.</p>

<p>Hanging, however, is "dishonorable." Nobles who
have especially exasperated their judges are sometimes
subjected to it. Henceforth people will cry, "Their
father was a felon," to their disgraced children. When
a villein is ordered to die, he is ordinarily hanged, unless
some other method is specified. In the village near St.
Aliquis the gallows is near the pillory. It is not so
large as that huge gallows at Montfaucon, near Paris,
which sees the end of so many of the city offenders, and
where there is a great series of stone piers with wooden
crosspieces, arranged in two stories, making twenty-four
compartments in all. There are permanent ladders
fixed for dragging up the criminals. When all the compartments
are full and additional room is needed for
more executions, some of the skeletons are thrown into
a deep, hideous pit in the center of the structure. The
less pretentious St. Aliquis gallows has only four compartments.
The structure stands close to the road, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
all may learn how energetic are the baron's provosts.
Two compartments are now empty, however, and Sire
Macaire is glad of a chance to fill them.</p>

<p>Because the two bandits made prompt confession
they are not subjected now to a "previous" torture&mdash;that
is, to a new racking as an extra punishment before
execution. They are compelled, however, to perform
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amende honorable</i>. This involves being haled to
the parish church in the village. A long candle is thrust
in the hands of each victim. They are dragged forward
by a noose, and at the door of the church cast themselves
down and cry; "We have grievously sinned against
Heaven. Our punishment is just. We beg pardon of
God and man. May Heaven have mercy upon our souls!"
Then they are forced back to the cart whereon they
are being trundled to execution.</p>

<p>"Riding the cart" is a familiar phrase for going to
the gallows. For a noble prisoner to be compelled to
take his last journey upon a cart, instead of cavalier-wise
upon a horse, is the last touch of degradation. The
two bandits, securely pinioned, are placed in a two-wheeled
vehicle, attended by Ma√Ætre Denis and an
assistant, and with Father Gr√©goire repeating prayers.
They seem followed by all the lewd fellows of the baser
sort in the entire region, and even certain knights and
dames, come for the tournament, are not above craning
their necks and gazing after the noisy procession. A
hanging is just infrequent enough in St. Aliquis to afford
a little excitement. At the gallows Ma√Ætre Denis acts
with a fearful dexterity. First one, next the other,
criminal is dragged up the ladder with the noose about his
neck, then swung off into eternity with a merciful
speed. A good hangman does not let his victims suffer
long. Soon a great flock of crows will be flapping around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
the gallows, giving the last rites to the lawbreakers, and
the ogling crowd will slink away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ceremonies at an Execution</div>

<p>The poor wretches are fortunate in that their anguish
is not prolonged by such customs as obtain at Paris.
There many death carts stop at the Convent of the
Filles-Dieu, where the nuns are obligated to give every
condemned criminal a glass of wine and three pieces
of bread. This pathetic meal is seldom refused, and a
great throng will stand gaping about until it is consumed.
Father Gr√©goire, too, had mercifully refrained from a long
public exhortation at the gallows as to how, literally,
"the wages of sin is death," another custom ere offenders
are turned off. But after the deed is over, confessor,
executioner, and provost do not decline their perquisite
after every such ceremony&mdash;a liberal banquet at the
castle.</p>

<p class="mb2">These proceedings have been unpleasant but not
unusual interludes between such happenings as the
wedding and the adubbement. It is time to return to
young Squire Aimery, and see how he has been educated
and "nourished" preparatory to the greatest event in
his life.</p>

<h2>Chapter XI: The Education of a Feudal
Nobleman.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_197.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">T</span>o the noble troubadour Bertran de Born,
a congenial comrade of Richard the
Lion Hearted, is attributed a little song
which seems re-echoed in many a castle.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Peace delights me not!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">War&mdash;be thou my lot!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Law&mdash;I do not know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save a right good blow!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="sidenote">Nobles Delight in War</div>

<p>Even a seigneur who nods pious assent to all that the
monks and priests affirm in praise of peace wishes in
his heart that it were not sinful to pray for brisk fighting.
To be a good warrior, to be able to take and give
hard blows, to enjoy the delights of victory over
doughty adversaries, and finally to die a warrior's
death on "the field of honor," not a "cow's death" in
one's bed&mdash;that is the ambition of nearly every noble
worthy of his gentility.</p>

<p>Bertran de Born has again expressed this brutal joy
in still greater detail:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I prize no meat or drink beside<br /></span>

<p>Clearly other and supposedly more peaceful ages will
find in the Feudal Epoch a very bloody world.</p>

<p>There is at least this extenuation. Even in France the
winters are cold, the days short,
the nights long. Castles at best
are chilly, musty barracks. Many
people are living in a small space
and are constantly jostling one
another. Thanks to sheer ennui,
many a baron becomes capricious
and tyrannical. Even in summertime,
hunts, hawking, jongleurs'
lays, and tournaments grow stale.
Often the average cavalier is in a
receptive mood for war just because
he is grievously bored.</p>

  <span class="caption"> COSTUME OF A NOBLEMAN (THIRTEENTH CENTURY)</span>
</div>

<p>The countenances of the older
warriors around St. Aliquis; the
great scars on cheek, chin, and
forehead; the mutilated noses
and ears&mdash;tell how strenuous
have been most of their lives.
The scars are badges of honor. Aimery is nigh regretful
that there are no slashes on his youthful countenance,
although Sire Eustace, his mentor, grimly assures him
"this trouble will pass with time." Aimery is now nineteen.
His brother gave him a careful training, as becoming
the cadet of a great house, and then arranged that he
be "nourished"&mdash;that is, taken into the family and educated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
as squire&mdash;by a powerful count. Unfortunately,
just as Aimery was about to demand knighthood of his
lord, the latter suddenly died. He therefore returned to
St. Aliquis and waited some months impatiently, until
Conon could give him an adubbement worthy of the
St. Aliquis name.</p>

<p>From earliest youth Aimery has had success in arms
held before him as the one thing worth living for. True,
he has been taught to be pious. He understands it is
well that God has created priests and monks, who may
by their ceremonies and prayers enable the good warriors
to enter into paradise. But the squire has never had
the slightest desire to become a cleric himself. He
thanks his divine patroness, St. G√©nevieve, that Conon
has not treated him as so many younger brothers are
treated, and forced him into the Church. What is it to
become a lazy rich canon, or even a splendid lord bishop,
beside experiencing even the modest joys of a common
sire with a small castle, a fast horse, good hawks,
and a few stout retainers? Aimery has learned to attend
mass devoutly and to accept implicitly the teachings
of the priests, but his moral training is almost entirely
based on "courtesy," a very secular code indeed. Hence
he acts on the advice given him while very young:
"Honor all churchmen, but look well to your money."</p>

<p>Another well-remembered warning is never to put
trust in villeins. He cannot, indeed, refuse to deal with
them. He must treat them ordinarily with decency, but
never trust them as real friends. The ignoble are
habitually deceitful. They cannot understand a cavalier's
"honor." They are capable of all kinds of base
villainies. A sage man will have comradeship only with
his nobly born peers, and pride is no fault in a baron
when dealing with inferiors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Literary Education of Young Nobles</div>

<p>Although he is to be a warrior, Aimery has been given
a certain training in the science of letters. It is true
that many seigneurs cannot read a word on the parchments
which their scriveners interpret, draw up, or seal
for them,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> but this is really very inconvenient. Conon
is genuinely thankful he is not thus at the mercy of
Father Gr√©goire. Another reason for literacy is that delightful
books of romantic adventure are multiplying.
The younger brother has, therefore, been sent over to
the school at the neighboring monastery, where (along
with a few other sons of noblemen) he has had enough
of the clerk's art switched into him to be able to read
French with facility, to pick out certain Latin phrases,
and to form letters clumsily on wax tablets&mdash;writing
with a stylus something after the manner of the ancients.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Once possessed of this wonderful art of reading that
Aimery had while yet a lad, he could delve into the
wonderful parchments of romances which told him of
the brave deeds done of old. Especially, he learned
all about the Trojan War, which was one long baronial
feud between North French cavaliers fighting for the
fair Helen, imprisoned in a strong castle. His sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
was excited for Hector as the under dog. He read of
many exploits which had escaped the knowledge of
Homer, but which were well known to Romance trouv√®res.
He reveled in scenes of slaughter whereof the
figures are very precise, it being clearly stated that
870,000 Greeks and 680,000
Trojans perished in the
siege of that remarkable
Trojan fortress.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Almost equally interesting
was the history of Alexander,
based on the version
of the pseudo-Callisthenes.
This was very unlike the
accounts which other ages
consider authentic. The
names of the battles with
Darius were altered, strange
adventures with the Sirens
crept into the narrative,
and finally Alexander (the
tale ran) died sorely lamenting
that he could not
conquer France and make
Paris his capital.</p>

<p>The story of C√¶sar is also available, but it seems less
romantic, although full of episodes of fairies and dwarfs.</p>

<p>For the history of France, Aimery has learned that
the country was originally settled by exiled Trojans;
later the Romans came, and some time later one meets
the great Emperor Charlemagne, whose exploits entwine
themselves with Charles Martel's defeat of the Saracens.
Charlemagne, we gather, conducted a crusade to the
Holy Land and took Jerusalem, although later the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Infidels regained it. Recent French history remains
very mixed in the young noble's mind until the great
Council of Clermont (1095), which launched the First
Crusade. In the century after that great episode, however,
the events stand out clearly, and of course he
knows all the history of the local baronial houses down
to the story of the petty feud forty years ago between
two Burgundian counts.</p>

<p>But what is monk's or jongleur's lore compared with
the true business of a born cavalier? When he was only
seven or eight, Aimery was fencing with a blunted sword.
From ten onward he took more regular fencing lessons,
first from Sire Eustace; then from a professional master,
a keen Gascon, hired by Conon. Equally early he had
his horse, his hawks, and his dogs; he was taught how
to care for them entirely himself, and was soon allowed
to go on long rides alone into the dense forest in order
to develop his resourcefulness, sense of direction, and
woodcraft. Then, as he grew taller, his brother began
to deliver long lectures for his betterment, even as
Adela had admonished Alienor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Maxims for Youthful Cavaliers</div>

<p>One day Conon exhorted him in the style of the old
Count Guy advising his son Doon in the epic, "Doon
of Mayence." "Ask questions of good men whom you
know, but never put trust in a stranger. Every day,
fair brother, hear the holy mass; and whenever you
have money give to the poor&mdash;for God will repay you
double. Be liberal in gifts to all, for a cavalier who is
sparing will lose all in the end and die in wretchedness;
but wherever you can, give without promising to give
again. When you come to a strange house, cough very
loudly, for there may be something going on there
which you ought not to see. When you are in noble
company, play backgammon; you will be the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
prized on that account. Never make a noise or jest in
church; it is done only by unbelievers. If you would
shun trouble, avoid meddling and pretend to no knowledge
you do not possess. Do not treat your body
servant as your equal&mdash;that is, let him sit by you at
table or take him to bed with you; for the more honor
you do a villein the more he will despise you. After
you are married by no means tell a secret to your wife;
for if you let her know it you will repent your act the
first time you vex her." And with this shrewd thrust at
Adela the flow of wisdom temporarily ceases.</p>

<p>Before he was fifteen Aimery had thus learned to read
and write, to ride and hawk, to play chess, checkers,
and backgammon, to thrum a harp and sing with clear
voice, to shoot with the arbalist, and to fence with
considerable skill. He was also learning to handle a
light lance and a shield while on horseback. Then
came his first great adventure&mdash;his brother sent him
to the gentle Count of Bernon to be "nourished."</p>

<p>The higher the baron the greater his desire to have
nobly born lads placed in his castle as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">nourris</i>, to serve
as his squires and be trained as cavaliers. Bernon had
kept three squires simultaneously, as did Conon himself.
It is a friendly courtesy to send word to an old comrade
in arms (as these two seigneurs had been), saying:
"You have a fine son (or brother); send him to be
'nourished' in my castle. When he is of ripe age I will
give him furs and a charger and dub him knight."
Of course, it was a high honor to be reared by a very
great lord like the Duke of Quelqueparte; but younger
sons or brothers did not often enjoy such good fortune.
Petty nobles had to send their sons to the manors of
poor sires of their own rank, who could keep only one
squire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Training of a Squire</div>

<p>Once enrolled as squire to a count, Aimery soon
learned that his master was a kind of second father to
him&mdash;rebuking and correcting him with great bluntness,
but assuming an equal responsibility for his training.
Hereafter, whatever happened, no ex-squire could fight
against his former master without sheer impiety. The
Emperor Charlemagne once, in a passion, smote the
hero Roland in the face. Roland turned red. His fist
clenched&mdash;then he remembered how Charlemagne had
"nourished" him. He accepted an insult which to
him no other mortal might proffer.</p>

<p>It is held that no father or brother can enforce sufficient
discipline over a growing lad, and that "it is proper
he shall learn to obey before he governs, otherwise he will
not appreciate the nobility of his rank when he becomes
a knight." Aimery in the De Bernon castle surely
received his full share of discipline, not merely from
the count, but from the two older squires, who took
pains at first to tyrannize over him unmercifully, until
they became knighted, and he gained two new companions
younger than himself, with whom he played
the despot in turn.</p>

<p>In his master's service Aimery became expert in the
use of arms. First he was allowed to carry the count's
great sword, lance, and shield, and to learn how the
older nobles could handle them. Next he was given
weapons and mail of his own, and began the tedious
training of the tilt yard, discovering that a large part of
his happiness in life would consist in being able to hold
his lance steady while his horse was charging, to strike
the point fairly on a hostile shield until either the tough
lance snapped or his foe was flung from the saddle, and
at the same time to pinch his own saddle tightly with
his knees while with his own shield covering breast and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
head against a mortal blow. Couch, charge, recover&mdash;couch,
charge, recover&mdash;he must practice it a thousand
times.</p>

<p>Meantime he was attending the count as a constant
companion. He rose at gray dawn, went to the stables,
and curried down his master's best horse; then back to
the castle to assist his superior to dress. He waited on
his lord and lady at table. He was responsible for receiving
noble guests, preparing their chambers and generally
attending to their comfort. On expeditions he led
the count's great war charger when the seigneur rode his
less fiery palfrey; and he would pass his lord his weapons
as needed. At tournaments he stood at the edge of the
lists, ready to rush in and rescue the count from under
the stamping horses if he were dismounted. He was
expected to fight only in emergencies, when his master
was in great danger; but Bernon was a gallant knight,
and repeatedly in hot forays Aimery had gained the
chance to use his weapons.</p>

<p>At the same time he was learning courtesy. He was
intrusted with the escort of the countess and her daughters.
He entertained with games, jests and songs
noble dames visiting the castle. He learned all the
details of his master's affairs. The count was supposed
to treat him as a kind of younger self&mdash;intrust him
with secrets, send him as confidential messenger on
delicate business, allow him to carry his purse when he
journeyed, and keep the keys to his coffers when at home.
After Aimery became first squire he was expected also
to assist the seneschal in a last round of the castle at
night, to make sure everything was locked and guarded;
then he would sleep at the door of the count's chamber.
Beyond a doubt, since the count was an honorable and
capable man, Aimery received thereby a training of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
enormous value. While still a lad he had large responsibilities
thrust upon him, and learned how to transmit
commands and to handle difficult situations. He was
versed in all the ordinary occasions of a nobleman.
When he became a
knight himself, he
would be no tyro in
all the stern problems
of feudal life.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Thus Conon's
brother came within
four years to be an
admirable <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">damoiseau</i>
(little lord), an
epithet decidedly more
commendatory than
its partial equivalent
"squire" (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ecuyer</i>,
shield bearer).<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Martial Exercises, the Quintain</div>

<p>Of course, his military
training had proceeded
apace. Soon he was allowed to tilt with his horse
and lance at the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">quintain</i>. This is a manikin covered
with a coat of mail and a shield, and set on a post. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
horseman dashes up against it at full gallop, and tries to
drive his lance through shield and armor. There are many
variations for making the sport harder. After Aimery
could strike the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">quintain</i> with precision he took his
first tilt against an older squire. Never will he forget
the grinding shock of the hostile lance splintering upon
his shield; the almost irresistible force that seemed
smiting him out of the saddle; the dismay when he
found his own lance glancing harmlessly off the shield
of his opponent, slanted at a cunning angle. But practice
makes perfect. When he finally returned to St. Aliquis
his own brother was almost unhorsed when they tried
a friendly course by the barbican.</p>

<p>So Aimery completed his education. If he has failed
to learn humility, humanity to villeins, and that high
respect for women which treats them not merely as
creatures to be praised and courted, but as one's moral
and intellectual equals, he at least has learned a high
standard of honor in dealing with his fellow nobles.
The confidences his master has reposed in him have
made it a fundamental conviction that it were better
to perish a dozen times than to betray a trust. He
believes that the word of a cavalier should be better
than the oath of the ignoble. As for courage, it were
better to die like Ganelon, torn by wild horses, than to
show fear in the face of physical danger. He has been
trained also to cultivate the virtue of generosity to an
almost ruinous extent.</p>

<p>Free giving is one of the marks of a true nobleman.
Largess is praised by the minstrels almost as much as
bravery. "He is not a true knight who is too covetous."
Therefore money is likely to flow like water through
Aimery's fingers all his life. The one redeeming fact
will be that, though he will be constantly <em>giving</em>, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
will always be as constantly <em>receiving</em>. Among the
nobles there is an incessant exchanging of gifts&mdash;horses,
armor, furs, hawks, and even money. All wealth really
comes from the peasants, yet their lords dispose carelessly
of it even though they do not create it. Even the villeins,
however, will complain if their masters do not make the
crowds scramble often for coppers&mdash;never realizing that
these same coppers represent their own sweat and
blood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Demanding Knighthood</div>

<p>As already stated, Aimery's master had died (to his
squire's sincere grief) shortly before the latter could
have said to him according to the formula, "Fair Sire,
I demand of you knighthood." The young man has
accordingly returned to St. Aliquis, and waited for some
action by his brother. Knighthood means for a noble
youth the attainment of his majority. It involves
recognition as a complete member of that aristocracy
which was separated by a great gulf from the villeins.
Very rarely can the base-born hope for that ceremonial
buffet which admits them to the company of the gentle.
If a peasant has exhibited remarkable courage and
intelligence, and above all has rendered some extraordinary
service to a duke or king, sometimes his villein
blood may be forgotten officially. But even if he is
knighted, all his life he can be treated as a social upstart,
his dame despised and snubbed by noblewomen, and
his very grandchildren reminded of the taint of their
ancestor.</p>

<p>True, indeed, not all men of nobility can become
knights. Knighthood ordinarily implies having a minimum
of landed property, and ability to live in aristocratic
idleness. Many poor nobles, and especially the
younger sons of poor nobles, remain bachelors, fretting
upon their starving properties, or serving some seigneur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
as mercenaries, and hoping for a stroke of fortune so
that they can demand knighthood. But they are likely
to die in their poverty, jealous of the rich sires, yet
utterly scornful of the peasants and thanking the saints
they are above touching a plow, mattock, or other
vulgar means of livelihood.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are many seigneurs who,
although rich and dubbed as knights, nevertheless give
the lie to their honors by their effeminacy and luxury.
They are worse than the baron whom we saw as a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">trouv√®re</i> and collector of minstrels' romances, and
who even read Latin books. The monkish preachers
scold such weaklings and pretended gallants. "To-day
our warriors are reared in luxury. See them leave for the
campaign! Are their packs filled with iron, with lances,
with swords? Not so, but with leathern bottles filled
with wine, with cheeses, and spits for roasting. One
would imagine that they were going to a feast in the
gardens and not to a battle. They carry splendidly
plated shields; but greatly they hope to bring them
back undented."<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Such unworthy knights unquestionably can be found,
but they have not tainted the whole nobility. Your
average cavalier has spent his entire life training for
combat; he dreams of lance thrusts and forays; and the
least of his sins is that he will shun deadly blows.</p>

<p class="mb2">At last the great day for which Aimery has waited
is at hand. To-morrow Conon will dub him a knight.</p>

chivalry was at its height the theory developed that a nobleman's

and from that time till he was one-and-twenty serving as a squire.

<h2>Chapter XII: Feudal Weapons and Horses.
Dubbing a Knight.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_210.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">T</span>he thing which really separates a noble
from a villein is the former's superiority
in arms. True, God has made the average
cavalier more honorable, courteous, and
sage than the peasant; but, after all,
his great advantage is material. The
villeins, poor churls, spend their days with shovel,
mattock, or in mechanic toil. Doubtless, they can grow
wheat, raise pigs, weave cloth, or build houses better
than their masters, but in the use of arms how utterly
are they inferior. How can a plowman, though you give
him weapons, hold his own against a man of gentility
who has been trained in arms from early boyhood. As
for the peasants with their ordinary weapons&mdash;flails,
boar spears, great knives, scythes set on poles, bows and
arrows&mdash;suppose ten of them meet one experienced
cavalier in full panoply upon a reliable charger. His
armor will turn their puny blows. He will, perhaps,
have brained or pinked through four of them before the
other six can run into the woods. No wonder nobles
give the law to villeins!</p>

<p>The noble is almost always a horseman. It is the
great war steed that gives him much of his advantage,
and a large part of the remainder comes from his magnificent
armor, which enables him often to go through
desperate contests unscathed, and which is so expensive
that most non-nobles can never afford it. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
good cavalier despises missile weapons, he loves to come
to grips. Bowmen are despised as being always villeins.
Says a poet, "Coward was he who was the first archer;
he was a weakling and dared not come close to his foe."
And many armies
are reckoned by
cavalry alone, even
as sang another
minstrel of a legendary
host, "there
were in it sixty
thousand knights,
not counting foot
soldiers of whom
no account is
taken."</p>

<p class="center">Restored by Viollet-Le-Duc, from a manuscript

</div>
</div>

<p>Old warriors dislike
arbalists, those
terrible crossbows,
wound up with a
winch, which enable
base-born infantrymen
to send heavy
bolts clear through
shirts of mail.
They are most unknightly things. In 1139 a Lateran
Council actually forbade their use against Christians.
Arbalists certainly are useful in sieges for clearing
ramparts or repelling attack; but they take so long to
wind up after every shot that their value in open battles
is limited. Crossbowmen, unless carefully protected,
can be ridden down by cavalry. So for another hundred
years the mailed knight will hold his own. Then may
come the English long-bow (far more rapid in its fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
than the arbalist), and the day of the infantry will
return.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Training to Fight in Armor</div>

<p>Knights are continually fighting, or at least are
exercising most violently in tourneys; yet the proportion
of contestants slain is not very great. This is
because their armor makes them almost invulnerable.
After a battle, if you count the dead, you find they are
usually all from the poor villein infantry or the luckless
camp followers. Yet this harness has inconveniences.
It is so heavy that the knight is the prisoner of his own
armor. He can hardly mount his horse unassisted.
Once flung from the saddle, he can scarcely rise without
help. The lightest suit of armor in common use weighs
at least fifty-five pounds. Powerful knights often wear
much heavier. Yet to be able to move about with
reasonable freedom, to swing one's shield, to control
one's horse, and finally to handle lance or sword with
great strength and precision, doing it all in this ponderous
clothing of metal, are what squires like Aimery must
learn to a nicety ere claiming knighthood. Wearing
such armor, it is not remarkable that noblemen always
prefer horseback, and fight on foot only in emergencies.</p>

<p>The prime unit in a suit of armor is the hauberk. He
who has a fine hauberk, light (considering the material),
pliable, and of such finely tempered steel as to be
all but impenetrable, has something worth a small
manor land. On this hauberk will often depend
his life.</p>

<p>In the olden days, before about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1000, the hauberk
was a shirt of leather or quilted cloth, covered by overlapping
metal plates like fishscales. Now, thanks to
ideas probably gathered from the Saracens, it is a shirt
of ring mails, a beautiful network of fine chains and
links, in the manufacturing of which the armorers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
("the worthiest folk among all villeins," declares Conon)
can put forth remarkable skill. The double or triple
links are all annealed. The metal is kept bright and
"white" by constant polishing (a regular task for the
squires), and Conon has one gala shirt of mail which
has been silvered. These garments form an almost complete
protection, thanks to long sleeves, a long skirt
below the knees, and a hood coming right over the head
and partly covering the cheeks. A few brightly colored
threads are sometimes worked into the links for ornament,
but the flashing sheen of a good hauberk is its sufficient
glory. The widowed Countess of Bernon has sent to
Aimery, as token of good will, a ring shirt belonging to
her husband. The knight-to-be swears that he will
never dishonor its former owner while he wears it.</p>

  <span class="caption">GERMAN HELMETS OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY</span>
</div>

<p>The next great unit in the armor is the helmet. Helmets
have been steadily becoming more complicated,
but most warriors still prefer a plain conical steel cap
encircled with a band
of metal which may
be adorned with gilt
enamel. It has also a
"nasal," a metal bar
to protect the nose.
Helmets are usually
laced to the hood of
the hauberk by small
leathern straps. Since
even a light and well-tempered helmet is an uncomfortable
thing, you seldom wear it until just before going
into action. "Lace helmets!" is the order to get ready
for a charge; and after a knight is wounded the first
friendly act is to unlace his headpiece. By the early
thirteenth century helmets are beginning to have closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
visors to keep out missiles. But these visors are immovable
without taking off the whole helm; and if
they get displaced and the small eyeholes are shifted,
the wearer is practically blind. The old-style open helm
will therefore continue in vogue until the coming of the
elaborate plate armor and the more manageable jointed
helms of the fourteenth century.</p>

  <img src="images/i_214.jpg" width="272" height="500" alt="A THIRTEENTH-CENTURY SHIELD" />
  <span class="caption">A THIRTEENTH-CENTURY SHIELD</span>
</div>

<p>The third great protection is the shield. These have
been getting smaller as hauberks and helmets have
been improving; but one cannot trust solely to the body
armor. Besides, a shield is a kind of
offensive weapon. A sharp thrust with
its edge or a push with its broad surface
may often knock your opponent over.
Aimery's new shield is semioval and
slightly pointed at the bottom. It
covers its possessor from shoulder to
knees while sitting on his horse. The
stoutest kind of hide is used in making
it, with a backing of light, tough wood,
and a strong rim of metal. It curves
inward slightly for the better protection
of the body. In the center is a
metal knob, usually of brilliant brass,
and the name "buckler" comes from this strong "boss"
(<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">boucle</i>). There is a big leather strap by which the
shield is ordinarily carried about the neck; but when
you go into action you run your left arm through two
strong handles.</p>

<p>A shield seems a simple object, but almost as much
skill goes into compacting the wood, leather, and metal
into one strong mass, not easily split or pierced, as into
making the hauberk. The front, of course, is highly
colored, and, although the heraldic "coat armor" has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
yet hardly developed, every cavalier will flaunt some
design of a lion, eagle, dragon, cross, or floral scroll.
As for the handling of the shield, it is nearly as great
a science as the handling of the sword; indeed, the
trained warrior knows how to make shield and sword,
or shield and lance, strike or fend together almost as
one weapon.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 240px;"><a id="i_215"></a>
  <img src="images/i_215.jpg" width="240" height="500" alt="THIRTEENTH-CENTURY SWORDS" />
  <span class="caption">THIRTEENTH-CENTURY SWORDS</span>
</div>

<p>Nevertheless, it is the strictly offensive weapons on
which the noble warrior sets greatest store, and the
weapon <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i> is the sword. Barons often love
their swords perhaps more than
they love their wives. They treat
them almost as if they are persons.
They try to keep them
through their entire lives. According
to the epics, the hero
Roland liked to talk to his sword
"Durendal," and Ogier to his
"Brans." Conon swears one of
his fiercest oaths, "by my good
sword 'Hautemise,'" and Aimery
has named his new sword "Joyeuse,"
after the great blade of
Charlemagne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Swords and Lances</div>

<p>There are many fashions in
swords. You can always revive
a flagging conversation by asking
whether your companion likes a
tapering blade or one of uniform
thickness and weight. But the
average weapon is about three
inches wide at the hilt, and some thirty-two inches
long in blade, slightly tapering. The hilt should be
adorned with gilt, preferably set with pearls, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
the end have a knob containing some small saints'
relics placed behind a bit of crystal to reveal the holy
objects. Conon's Hautemise thus contains some dried
blood of St. Basil, several hairs of St. Maurice, and lint
from the robe which St. Mary Magdalene wore after
she repented. These relics are convenient, for whenever
a promise must be authenticated, the oath taker
merely claps his hand on his hilt, and his vow is instantly
registered in heaven.</p>

<p>The lance is the other great weapon of the cavalier.
Normally you use it in the first combats, and resort to
your sword only after the lance is broken. The average
lance is not more than ten feet long.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> It has a lozenge-shape
head of fine Poitou or Castile steel. Care must
be taken in selecting straight, tough, supple wood for
the shaft and in drying it properly, for the life of the
warrior may depend on the reliability of his lance shaft,
and the amount of sudden strain which it can stand in
a horse-to-horse encounter. Ashwood is ordinarily
counted the best. As a rule there is no handle on the
butt. The art of grasping the round wood firmly, of
holding the long weapon level with the hip, and finally
of making the sharp tip strike squarely on the foeman's
shield (however he may slant the latter) is a matter of
training for wrist and eye which possibly exceeds all
skill in fencing. The whole body works together in
lance play. The horse must be guided by the knees;
the shield must be shifted with the left hand, the lance
with the right; the eye and nerves must be under perfect
control&mdash;and then, with man and horse fused into one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>flying weapon, away you go&mdash;what keener sport can
there be in the world?<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_217"></a>

</div>
</div>

<p>Yet there is something more important to the warrior
than his panoply. What is a cavalier without his horse?
Few, indeed, are the humans whom the best of barons
will set above his favorite
destrer. Your
horses are comrades
in hunt, tourney, and
battle. By their speed
and intelligence they
save your life when
squire or vassal avail
not. When they fail,
commend your soul to
the saints&mdash;you will
soon be in purgatory.
From boyhood a cavalier
has almost lived
in the saddle. When
in danger he knows all
the capacities of his charger, and trusts him accordingly.
Such a companion is to be treated with care. He is fed
daintily; he is combed and tricked out like a delicate
woman, and when ill he is physicked with more wisdom
possibly than will be vouchsafed to most Christian denizens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
of a castle. Stories abound of how horses have
succored their masters and stood watch over them while
sleeping; and even one tale of how, when a knight
returned after seven years, he was not recognized by
his betrothed, but was by his faithful destrer. Another
anecdote is how a knight answered, on being asked,
"What will be your chief joy in paradise?" "To see
Blanchart, my old horse."</p>

<p>Such being the case, the greatest pains are taken
with horse breeding. Rich seigneurs rejoice in valuable
stallions, and even monasteries keep breeding stables.
A fine horse is an even more acceptable gift to a potentate
than a notable hawk. Many horses are called "Arabian,"
but probably these come from North Africa. In France
are raised horses equal to the best, especially those
powerful steeds not quite so swift as the Oriental, but
better able to bear a knight in ponderous armor. Gascon
horses are in particular demand, and Conon takes
peculiar satisfaction in a brood mare from Bordeaux.
To ride a mare, however, is regarded as unknightly&mdash;"the
women to the women"&mdash;probably an old Teutonic
prejudice.</p>

<p>Aimery, while squire, found the care of the count's
horses a prime duty. This was no trifle, for De Bernon,
like every magnate, always kept several palfreys, handsome
steeds of comfortable pace for peace-time riding,
besides his special destrer&mdash;the great fierce war horse for
battle. "To mount the high horse"&mdash;the destrer&mdash;is to
show one's pride, not by vain boasting, but by displaying
oneself in terrible weapons.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Of course, however, the
haughty young squire did not have to bother about his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
lord's <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">roncins</i>, the ordinary steeds for the servants, or
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sommiers</i> for the baggage, humbler creatures still.</p>

<p>The favorite color for horses is white; after that dappled
gray; after that bay or chestnut. Poets exhaust
their skill in describing beautiful steeds, as if they were
beautiful women. Wrote one bard about a Gascon
horse: "His hair outshone the plumage of a peacock;
his head was lean; his eye gray like a falcon; his breast
large and square; his crupper broad; his thigh round;
and rump tight. All beholding him exclaimed 'they
had never seen a handsomer creature!'"</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Such precious beings have names
of honor. Charlemagne's destrer
was the great Tencendur. Roland
charged on Veilantif. Carbonel,
Palantamur, Grisart are familiar
names; and Conon's dearly loved
companion is Regibet, whom, with
all his fierceness, the baron could
ride safely without bit, bridle, or
spurs. The harness of the war
horse is still very simple. The
elaborate trappings and armor belong
to a later age, but the stirrups
and high saddle can be gilded and
even set with pearls. More noticeable
still are the dozens of little bells
on different parts of the harness,
which jingle merrily like sleigh bells
of another age, as the great steeds
pound along.</p>

<p>Aimery has lived where hauberks,
helms, shields, swords, and lances have been the small coin
of conversation since he has been able to talk. He has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
come to know horseflesh far better than he knows that
other important mortal thing called "woman." He has
now reached the age when he is extremely confident in
his own abilities and equally confident that a fame like
Roland's or Godfrey of Bouillon's is waiting him, provided
the saints will assist. If he could have followed
daydreaming, he would have been
dubbed knight by the king himself
after mighty deeds on the field of
battle, while still covered with blood
and grime; but such fair fortune
comes only in the romances. At
least, he is glad that he has a brother
who is a brother indeed, and does not
keep him in the background nor
withhold from him his inheritance,
as is the luck of so many younger
sons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Candidates for Knighthood</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 278px;"><a id="i_220"></a>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A THIRTEENTH-CENTURY KNIGHT</p>
<p class="center">From sculpture in the

</div>
</div>

<p>It is a great grief that Aimery's
father is not living to see his sons
"come to knighthood." A good
father always looks forward to that
happy day; although in some disordered
fiefs the seigneur will have
to watch jealously lest the moment
his offspring become full-fledged warriors
they are not worked upon by disloyal vassals who
will tell them, "Your father is old, and cannot rule the
barony; seize it for yourselves." Even kings have to
guard against this danger. Philip Augustus has knighted
his heir, Prince Louis, only after the latter has taken a
solemn oath not to enroll armed followers or perform other
sovereign acts, save with his father's specific consent.</p>

<p>Theoretically, any knight can grant adubbement to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
any person he thinks worthy; but actually a knight
who dubs a villein, save in very exceptional circumstances,
will jeopardize his own claim to nobility;
and if he thrusts the honor on young, untried petty
nobles, he will be laughed at, and their claims to the
rank be promptly questioned. Fathers have often
dubbed their sons, but better still,
a young noble will seek the honor
from his suzerain. Aimery learns
with satisfaction that the Duke of
Quelqueparte has consented to give
the buffet of honor, for the higher
the rank of the adubbing cavalier,
the greater the glory of the ex-squire.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 270px;"><a id="i_221"></a>
  <img src="images/i_221.jpg" width="270" height="600" alt="A THIRTEENTH-CENTURY KNIGHT" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A THIRTEENTH-CENTURY KNIGHT</p>
<p class="center">From a bas-relief at the
cathedral of Rheims (Viollet-Le-Duc).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The adubbement of knights is still
a decidedly secular ceremony. Doubtless,
the custom can be somewhat
traced back to the crude rites whereby
Germanic youths were initiated into
the ranks of first-class warriors. Beyond
the vigil in the church and the
hearing of mass, there is not much
that is religious about it. Clerical
customs are indeed intruding. Young
nobles like to visit Rome and be
dubbed by the Pope. Others now
are beginning to kneel before bishops and crave knighthood
as a kind of lay consecration. Opinion, however,
still frowns on this. Adubbement is a military business
and churchmen had better keep their place. It will
be more than a hundred years before religion and sentimentality
can intrude much into what has long been
a distinctly martial affair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ceremonies Before Adubbement</div>

<p>Easter, Ascension Day, Pentecost and St. John's day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>are acceptable times for adubbements; but there are
plenty of precedents for combining the ceremony with
an important wedding, as it might be with the baptism
of the heir to a barony. In the
present case, moreover, as happens
very often, Aimery, although the
chief candidate for knighthood, is
not alone. The duke will give the
qualifying blow to five other young
men, sons of the St. Aliquis vassals;
and, indeed, twenty or more candidates
are often knighted together at
the king's court.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 245px;"><a id="i_222"></a>
  <img src="images/i_222.jpg" width="245" height="600" alt="A BEGGAR" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A BEGGAR</p>
  <p class="center">End of the twelfth
century (from a manuscript in the Biblioth√®que nationale).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The night before the ceremony
the whole castle is in as great a stir
as before the wedding. More
guests, more feasting, more jongleurs,
perpetual singing, music, noise.
Upon the table in the great hall
Adela and Alienor (as substitutes
for Aimery's mother) have laid out
for public admiration the costume
which he will assume the next day.
The articles are selected as carefully as for the bridal&mdash;especially
the spotless white shirt, the costly robe
of ermine, and the spurs of gold. A host of beggars
swarm in the bailey, for this occasion calls for an
unusual recklessness of almsgiving. Even the invited
guests are throwing around coppers, thereby proving
their nobility.</p>

<p>As for Aimery, when the evening falls he and his five
companions take a complete bath, not without considerable
solemnity. This act has genuine significance.
"It is to efface all villainies of the past life, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
bather may come out pure."<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> There are no boisterous
splashing and merrymaking as the youths sit in the long
wooden bathtubs. While they dress themselves, smiling
sergeants appear with presents. Relatives, the suzerain,
noble friends, have sent them articles of costly apparel,
usually silken and fur-lined, to wear during their "vigil
at arms." These are very much like the gifts that are
showered upon a bride.</p>

<p>It is about half a mile from St. Aliquis castle to the
parish church. After their bath the six candidates go
hither, attended by the youths who are to become their
squires. The company is joyous, but not noisy; violent
mirth were unbecoming. At the church the squires-to-be
leave the others. The candidates enter the great
dark building. On the high altar a lamp burns, and on
the side altar of St. Martin, the warrior saint, is a blaze
of candles before a picture showing the holy man in the
costume of a knight giving half of his military cloak to
a beggar. The new weapons and armor of the candidates
have been laid upon this altar. Then the vigil
begins. The six knights-elect must not converse. They
can only stand, or kneel at preference, for the whole
ten hours&mdash;a serious physical ordeal.</p>

<p>During the solemn silence they are expected to pray
to all their patron saints and make solemn vows to
govern their whole life. It is a time for serious meditation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
and Aimery beseeches, "Give to me honor," loyally
adding, "and to my brother long life!" He does not
ask "honor" for Conon also, for that would imply the
mighty baron still needed it. Then at last dawn creeps
through the storied windows. An old priest enters and
says mass, which the candidates follow gravely. At
six in the morning, with the summer air bright and
beautiful around them, they are all going again to the
castle, merry and talkative in reaction from the long
constraint.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dressing the Candidates</div>

<p>Back in the castle Aimery is glad of an unusually
hearty breakfast. Not merely has the long vigil of
standing wearied him, but he will need all his strength
for the ordeal of the day. Next he goes to his chamber,
where the stripling who is to be his squire, the son of a
friendly baron, puts on his new master's gala dress.
White is the predominant color&mdash;"whiter than the
snow of the April flowers." Friends of his brother
come in to witness the process, and compliment the
candidate very openly upon his broad shoulders, healthy
complexion, and hardened sinews. These congratulations
become more pronounced when a bustling servitor
announces that "all is ready." Aimery strides into
the courtyard. The place seems crammed with knights
and dames, old and young, all in their best. Everybody
(partly from politeness, partly from genuine enthusiasm)
begins to call out: "How fine he is! A true
St. Aliquis! Right worthy of his brother!"</p>

<p>Immediately two loud trumpets announce the ceremony.
A great orchestra of jongleurs raises a clamor.
The sight is magnificent. The castle court seems alive
with color. The women are in striking costumes, with
their long hair hanging braided on their shoulders.
The knights wear either bliauts, green, blue, or red, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
hauberks of dazzling brightness. The numerous priests
present have on their finest robes. Even the monks
seem less somber in their habits. All is noise, music,
and animation.</p>

<p>The six candidates, followed by the whole rejoicing
company, cross the bailey and the lists and go forth to
the exercise ground by the garden. Here there is a
platform covered with fine Saracen carpets. The Duke
of Quelqueparte stands thereon, a majestic elderly warrior
in gilded armor. The six candidates form a semicircle
at the foot of the platform; then Aimery, as the brother
of the giver of the f√™te, is the first to mount.</p>

<p>Immediately his "first sponsor" presents himself, a
white-headed knight, a maternal uncle. Deliberately
he kisses the candidate; then, kneeling, puts on his two
golden spurs. As the uncle steps back, Conon and
Olivier present themselves. They are the second and
third sponsors. They pull a dazzling white steel hauberk
over Aimery's head and adjust its cape. Upon this last
they set the equally brilliant helmet, adorned with
semiprecious stones. Then the fourth sponsor, the
stately Count of Perseigne, girds on the candidate's
sword, adding a few words of admonition how the
younger man "must use it worthily"; to which the
other responds by lifting the weapon and piously kissing
the relics set in the hilt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Buffet of Knighthood</div>

<p>The four sponsors step back. The assembled jongleurs
give a mighty crash of music. The duke lifts his clenched
hand. "Bow the head!" he orders. "I will give you the
blow." Aimery bows himself meekly to the greater
lord, but his meekness is tested by the terrific stroke of
his suzerain's fist, which sends him reeling. But the
instant he recovers, the duke seizes him in comradely
embrace. "Be brave, Sire Aimery. Recall that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
are of a lineage famous both as seigneurs and as vassals,
and do nothing base. Honor all knights. Give to the
poor. Love God. Go!"</p>

<p>The happy cavalier replies: "I thank you, fair lord,
and may God hear you. Let me always serve and love
him." Then he descends the platform, and each of the
other candidates mounts in turn to be knighted with
similar ceremonies, although the sponsors (drawn from
relatives or connections) will be different. The crowd
standing round follows the proceedings with the uttermost
interest, joining in a mighty shout each time the
blow of honor is given. Then Conon, as master of
ceremonies, waves to his marshal. "Bring in the horses!"</p>

<p>Immediately the new squires to the new knights
appear, leading six steeds, faultlessly groomed and in
beautiful harness&mdash;the gift of the baron to the candidates.
The instant the horses are in front of the platform the
new cavaliers break from their statuesque rigidity.
Clothed as they are now in heavy hauberk and helmet,
they run, each man to his horse, and try to leap to the
saddle at one bound without touching foot to the stirrups.
An anxious moment for them; an equally anxious
moment for parents, brothers, or sisters. From the
time a young nobleman is in his cradle his mother will
discuss with his father, "Will he make the 'leap' when
he is knighted?" It is one of the great tests of a martial
education, and one that must be taken with the uttermost
publicity. Truth to tell, Aimery and his friends
have been practicing the feat with desperate energy for
the last month. Done! All six have mounted fairly!
Salvos of applause. His friends are congratulating
Conon: "Such a brother!" The kinsfolk of the other
young knights are similarly overwhelmed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Concluding Exercises</div>

<p>Meantime the happy new cavaliers hold their horses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'montionless'">motionless</ins> for an instant while their squires run to
them with their lances and triangular shields. The
lances have long bright pennons with three tails which
float down upon their riders' helmets. This act performed,
the riders put their steeds through all manner
of gallops and caracoles, and next, "singing high with
clear voice," away they go, flying toward a place on the
exercise ground where the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">quintain</i>&mdash;the wooden
manikin warrior&mdash;has been set up.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> To smash its shield
and fling it to the ground with a single lance thrust is
another unescapable test. This ordeal also is met by
Aimery and his peers with tolerable glory for all. After
this sport the new knights are expected to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">behourder</i>&mdash;that
is, to indulge in mock duels with blunted weapons.
These were not counted serious contests, but often
enough, if blood is high and rivalry keen, they can take
on the form of vigorous combats. To-day, however,
everybody is in too good humor for violent blows;
besides, the real tournament begins to-morrow, and it is
best to keep strength and weapons until then.</p>

<p>The morning is now spent. Seigneurial appetites
have been nobly whetted. The pavilions are again
ready in the garden, and the cooks have prepared
pasties, joints of meat, and great quantities of roast
poultry, even as for the wedding feast. There is another
round of gorging and guzzling, only this time the six
new knights occupy the place of honor, and the master
jongleur's story is not concerning sad Tristan, but about
how brave Godfrey of Bouillon stormed Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Everybody is commenting upon the admirable grace,
modesty, and proficiency in arms of Sire Aimery. A
count has approached Conon already before dinner.
"Fair Baron, you have a brother who is a credit to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
name. Is it true he is to receive Petitmur? I have a
daughter in her fifteenth year; her dowry will be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="mb2">But Conon tactfully shrugs his shoulders. "Fair

clerics to "smite with the edge of the sword," or to "shed
blood." The mace merely smote your foe senseless or dashed out
his brains, without piercing his lungs or breast!

<h2>Chapter XIII: The Tourney.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_229.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">W</span>hen Conon decided to give a tourney
as a climax to the wedding and adubbement
festivities, he sent out several
servitors of good appearance and loud
voices to course the country for some
twenty leagues around. These varlets
bawled their proclamation at every crossroad, village,
inn, and castle gate.</p>

<p>"The Wednesday after St. Ancildus Day, good people!
In the meadow at St. Aliquis by the Claire. The
Wednesday after St. Ancildus day! Let all come who
love to see or to join in deeds of valor!"</p>

<p>This is "crying the tourney." As soon as the news
spreads abroad, every petty sire takes council with his
wife whether he can afford to go. The women begin to
hunt up their best bliauts and furs; the men to furbish
their armor. Soon various cavaliers, arranging with their
friends, undertake to form challenge parties. They
write on a scroll "At the castle of A&mdash;&mdash; there are seven
knights who will be ready to joust with all comers to
St. Aliquis." This they post on a tree by the wayside
in order that other lordlings may organize similar parties
to confront them.</p>

<p>Tourneys are to be reckoned as "little wars themselves,
and the apprenticeship for great ones." They have an
inconceivably prominent place in feudal life. Vainly
the Church objects to them. All nobles will tell you that
without tourneys you can never train good warriors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Early Tourneys Were Battles</div>

<p>Tourneys, however, bring profit and pleasure to all
manner of people&mdash;no cause for unpopularity. The
"joy women," who rush to ply their sinful wiles despite
every attempt to restrict them; the common villeins,
who drop their work to enjoy one grand holiday; and
the merchants, who really hold a small fair near the lists,
all are delighted. As for men of gentle blood, an English
chronicler can state the case alike for France and England:
"A knight cannot shine in war if he has not been
prepared for it in tourneys. He must have seen his own
blood flow, have had his teeth crackle under the blow of
his adversary, have been dashed to the earth with such
force as to feel the weight of his opponent, and disarmed
twenty times; he must twenty times have retrieved his
failures, more than ever set on combat." <em>Then</em> he
will be ready for actual war and can hope to conquer!</p>

<p>In early feudal days tourneys differed from battles
merely in that the time and the place were fixed in
advance, and fair conditions arranged. According to
the epics, at "Charlemagne's court" the nobles often
got tired of ordinary sports and "demanded a tourney."
The results were merely pitched battles in which many
were slain and many more wounded.</p>

<p>There was no luxury, pomp, or patronage by fair
ladies at the earliest tourneys.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> They were exceedingly
violent pastimes in which "iron men" measured their
strength and rejoiced in deadly blows. Since then
tourneys have been getting less brutal. An important
spectacular element is intruding. The rules of combat
are becoming more elaborate, fewer knights are killed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
and there is an appeal to something better than mere
fighting instinct. On the other hand, in the thirteenth
century jousts and m√™l√©es are far from being mere displays
of fine armor and fine manners. The military
element is still uppermost. Furthermore, since the
vanquished cavaliers are the prisoners of the victors and
are subject to ransom, or at least their horses and armor
are forfeit, certain formidable knights go from tourney to
tourney deliberately seeking profit by taking prisoners.
In short, so dangerous are tourneys even yet, that as
recently as 1208, when Prince Louis, heir of King Philip,
was knighted, his father made him swear he would
merely watch them as spectator&mdash;for the life of a prince
royal is too precious to risk in such affairs.</p>

<p>The popes have long since denounced tourneys.
Innocent II, Eugenius III, Alexander III, and finally
the great and wise Innocent III have prohibited Christians
from participating in the same under peril of their
souls. But <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cui bono</i>? Great barons who shudder at
the thought of eating beef on Fridays defy the Church
absolutely when it comes to a matter of "those creations
of the devil" (to quote St. Bernard of Clairvaux)
in which immortal souls are so often sped.</p>

<p>When Conon decides to add a tourney as a climax to
his f√™te, a score of carpenters are hired down from Pontdebois
to help out the levy of peasants in preparing
the lists and lodges. Some of the guests have already
come to the wedding and the adubbement, but many
more arrive merely for the knightly contests. For these,
of course, the baron affords only limited hospitality&mdash;a
good place to pitch their tents, water and forage, with
perhaps an invitation to the castle hall at dinner time to
certain leaders. Many visitors can get accommodation
in the better houses in the village, or at the monastery;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
but, the weather being fine, the majority prefer to set out
their pavilions by the Claire, and the night before the
sports begin there seem to be tents enough for an army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lists and the Lodges</div>

<p>The visitors come in their best bliauts and armor.
Certain powerful counts collect as many lesser nobles as
possible, even making up bands of twenty knights,
twenty squires, a great number of ladies and waiting
women, also some hundreds of ignoble servitors. Except
for the presence of the women and the omission of
military precautions, you might think them going to an
ordinary muster for war.</p>

<p>Meantime, in the wide exercise ground where Sire
Aimery had been dubbed, the special lists are made
ready. These are simple affairs, something like a race
course of other days. Two pairs of strong wooden
palisades are erected. The outer line is shoulder high;
the inner is lower and has many openings. Between
the two lines is the space for spare horses, squires, attendants,
and heralds; also for privileged spectators.
The humbler onlookers will peer standing over the outer
palisade, but behind and above this rise the series of
lodges, shaded with tentlike canopies, floored with
carpets, and gay with pennons. In them will be stationed
the ladies and the older, less martial knights. The space
within the lists is some hundred yards long by fifty wide.
That evening Conon and Sire Eustace survey the decorations,
the forest of banners waving over the colored
pavilions of the visitors, and listen complacently to the
glad hum of voices and the jongleur's chants everywhere
arising.</p>

<p>"Ah, fair Baron," says the seneschal, "all France will
talk of this spear breaking until Christmas! It will be a
great day for St. Aliquis."</p>

<p>At gray dawn the heralds from the castle go through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
the avenues of tents, calling, monotonously: "Let the
jousters make ready! Let the jousters make ready!"</p>

<p>Soon squires half dressed are seen running to and fro.
There is a great saddling and girdling, neighing and
stamping. A few pious knights and dames hurry to the
castle chapel for a mass very hastily said, but the bulk
of the company cross themselves and mutter: "We will
be sinners to-day. The blessed saints are merciful!"
Presently, by the time the sun is well above the trees,
everybody is bound for the lists. The ladies, if possible,
ride white mules and are dressed as splendidly as for
their own weddings. Not in many a day will St. Aliquis
see again such displays of marten, ermine, and vair, of
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'sendel'">sendal</ins> and samite, of gold thread and pearls. The
common folk point and applaud loudly when an unusually
handsomely clad dame sweeps by. What right have
grand folk to claim the obedience of the lesser, if they
cannot delight the public gaze by their splendors? As
for the jongleurs, their name is legion. The whole affair
is characterized by a "music" becoming deafening.</p>

<p>While the dames and other noncombatants take seats
in the lodges, the six camp marshals&mdash;distinguished
knights in charge of the contests&mdash;appear in the lists.
They advance on foot, wearing very brilliant bliauts.
Conon, as giver of the festivities, is naturally at their
head. Behind follow the humbler born heralds and
pursuivants who will assist them, and encourage the
combatants with such cries as: "Remember whose son
you are!" "Be worthy of your ancestry!" There is also
a large squad of varlets and sergeants to keep order,
bring new lances, clear away broken weapons, and rescue
fallen knights. Conon's keen eye sweeps the tilt yard.
Everything is ready. The baron bows politely to his
suzerain, the duke and duchess, in the central lodge; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
he raises a white baton. "Bring in the jousters!" he
commands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brilliant Procession of Jousters</div>

<p>Instantly there is a great blare of trumpets from the
end of the lists farthest from the castle. Four gorgeously
arrayed heralds lead the procession on foot. Then comes
a jongleur on horseback, playing with his sword, tossing
it high in the air and catching as it whirls downward.
Next come the actual contestants, some eighty knights
riding two by two. They <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'do'">go</ins> down one side of the lists and
back the other. Some cavaliers turn deliberately to
ogle the ladies in the lodges, and the gentle dames (old
and young) are not backward in leaning forward and
waving in reply. It is a sight to stir the blood&mdash;all the
pageantry of war, without as yet its slaughter; the
presence of gorgeously clad women in graceful attitudes;
and the air charged with the excitement of brave deeds
and of genuine perils to come. Suddenly all the knights
begin to sing. The women catch up the chorus of some
rousing melody which makes the lists shake. The
cavaliers compel their horses to prance and curvet as
they go by some lady of especial favor. From many
lances are hanging bright streamers&mdash;not banners, but
sleeves and stockings, the gifts of friendly dames. The
younger knights are rejoiced by seeing damsels, whose
eye they have taken, rise in the lodges and then and
there, before the cheering hundreds, fling them "gages
of love." It is so with young Sire Aimery as he modestly
rides near the tail of the procession. The daughter of
the approving count stands boldly and casts him a long
red ribbon wherewith she had braided her hair. The
other new knights receive similar tokens from unabashed
admirers. This process will keep up <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'though'">through</ins> the games.
The shrieking, excited ladies will presently cast into the
lists gloves, girdles, and ribbons. Many will sit at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
end with only their flying hair, and their pelissons and
chemises for costume.</p>

<p>Some combatants are intent on grim business. These
are the professional jousters, determined to get as many
ransoms as possible and to maintain their own proud
reputation. Their armor is beautifully burnished; but
it is quite plain. They have prepared for a regular
battle. Other knights have painted their scabbards,
lance butts, and shields with brilliant white, red, or
black. On the crests of their helmets they have set
outlandish figures&mdash;monsters, heads of birds, or of
women. As in fancy balls of other days, their aim is to
attract attention by the peculiarity of their costumes.
Conon does not desire a bloody tourney and the funeral
of several friendly knights as a climax to his gayety.
Orders have therefore been given that all lance points are
to be blunted, also that all sword edges and points be
rounded. The tournament lances, too, are lighter than
the battle lances and made of brittle wood.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Nevertheless,
the blows struck will be terrible. The best leach from
Pontdebois is already in the duke's lodge, and his services
will be needed.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, a tourney falls into two parts&mdash;the
jousting always comes first, with the m√™l√©e, which is
the real tourney proper, as the grand climax to the
entire occasion.</p>

<p>What follows might seem to men of other days somewhat
monotonous after the novelty has worn away, although
the first contests are exciting enough. The competing
knights have been told off in pairs, partly by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>mutual consent, partly by the tactful arrangement of
the camp marshals. After the procession around the
lists, the contestants take their stations, some in the
saddle, some dismounted in the spaces between the
barriers. There is an awesome hush along the lodges
and in the great standing throng of the vulgar. A herald
calls in loud voice, "Let him come to joust who wishes to
do battle!" Instantly two keen trumpets answer each
other from opposite ends of the lists, and two pursuivants
come forward. These worthies are really only jongleurs
on less exciting days. They have now taken the deniers
of two young barons who are anxious to make a brave
appearance. The pursuivants are grotesquely dressed
with bright parti-colored mantles and bliauts. Each
begins bawling shrilly even while his rival is calling:
"Here is the good cavalier and baron, Ferri of St.
Potentin. A brave knight of a valorous house. He will
teach a lesson to his enemies!" "Here is the good cavalier,
Raoul, eldest son of the most puissant Count of
Maurevay. Watch now his deeds, all you who love
brave actions!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_236"></a>
  <img src="images/i_236.jpg" width="400" height="264" alt="A TOURNAMENT IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A TOURNAMENT IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY</p>
<p class="center">At the back are the galleries where the ladies sit; then, near the entrance to the lists, some cavaliers wait their turn to take
part in the contest; in the center, some servants and others of the contestants pick up one of the combatants who has been thrown
from his horse by his adversary.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then each of the twain reviles the master of the other:
"<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">He!</i> Your Sire Raoul is the son of a crow. All his
friends will this day be ashamed of him. Let him find his
ransom money!"</p>

<p>"Silence all boasts, you pursuivant of a caitiff master.
Sire Ferri, if he outlives the shock, will have his spurs
struck from his heels as being unworthy of knighthood!"</p>

<p>Meantime the two champions, rigid as statues, suffer
their squires to lead them upon their tall destrers to
opposite ends of the lists. When they are facing and
their squires have nodded that their masters are ready,
a marshal waves his white baton, calling loudly, "In
the name of God and St. Michael, do your battle!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lance Breaking in the Lists</div>

<p>All the dames, nobles, and base-born rise in the lodges
and shout together when suddenly the two knights and
their mighty horses spring to life. The ground quakes
and the sod flies when they rush down the lists as if
hurried toward each other by irresistible force. As they
gallop, each bends low in the saddle&mdash;swings his shield
to cover his body, lowers his helmet almost to the top of
his shield, swerves his horse so as to pass his opponent
on the right, and with sure grip drops his lance point
before him.</p>

<p>"Crash!" The splintering of wood can be heard through
the din from the lodges. Both horses are thrown upon
their haunches and are casting out great clods of earth.
Each knight is flourishing the broken butt of a lance and
across the shield of each there is a long jagged mark.</p>

<p>"Fairly broken! Fairly broken! A noble course!"
cries everyone. The two contestants wheel gracefully
and canter back to their stations. Squires run up with
fresh lances. Sire Raoul takes a new shield, the earlier
one showing signs of splitting as well as being battered.
Another course; another crash&mdash;and two more broken
lances. But at the third shock Sire Ferri meets utter
humiliation. He indeed meets Raoul's lance fairly on
his shield and again the tough wood is splintered, but
excitement, overconfidence, or the intervention of the
devil makes his wrist a little unsteady. At the moment
of collision Raoul swerves his body a trifle to the left.
Ferri's lance misses his foe's shield entirely. It flies off
in the air, and in the confusion escapes from his hand.
There is hooting from the villeins; worse still, there is
shrill derision from all the lodges. Sire Ferri rides back
to his post, grinding his teeth and swearing blasphemously.
He must now pay a ransom to Raoul for his
horse and armor, despite the boastings of his pursuivant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
and not even have the melancholy consolation of knowing
that he was unhorsed in a fair collision.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Bloody Duel</div>

<p>But the next duel has a more exciting ending. Two
cavaliers who now engage are exceptionally experienced
knights. At the first charge both horses sustain such a
shock when the lances shiver that their masters can
barely force them to their feet. At the second charge the
more skillful rider holds his lance so squarely that,
instead of its breaking, the opposing knight is fairly
flung out of the saddle&mdash;dashed from his horse and
sprawled headlong with a great clattering of armor. The
heralds and squires run to him and find that, thanks to
his hauberk, he has escaped dangerous wounds, though
he coughs away several teeth. Great is the excitement in
the lodges.</p>

<p>Several duels after this end in honorable draws. The
knights have agreed to "break three lances fairly for the
love of the ladies," and gallantly do so. There are no
victors or vanquished. Then it is proclaimed that two
seigneurs from Champagne, Sire Emeri and Sire Lourent,
having an especial desire to "debate together" (their
original quarrel had been over dice) are resolved to fight
until one cries "mercy," and will continue their battle
on foot should either be unhorsed. Three times they
break lances unscathed, but the fourth time Lourent's
stirrup parts and he is pitched upon the sands. Instantly
he is free from his snorting, plunging destrer and on
his feet, flourishing his great sword. Emeri now might
lawfully ride against him, but it is no chivalrous thing for
a mounted knight to attack an unmounted one. Down
he leaps also, making his blade dance above his head
like a stream of light. Then to the infinite joy of the
lodges the two cavaliers hack and feud with each other
for a good ten minutes, till the blood streams down their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
faces, the bright paint on their shields is marred, and
the crests of their helmets have vanished in dentings.
At last Emeri flings his strength into a lucky blow.
His sword is blunted, but by sheer weight of the stroke
the blade smashes Lourent's shield asunder, descending
like a smith's sledge upon his helmet. Lourent topples
like a log.</p>

<p>A great shout goes through the lodges. "Dead!" cry
many; but, to the relief of the women, the word presently
spreads that he is only soundly stunned, though the
leech says that "he will not fight again till Christmas."</p>

<p>The duels continue all through the morning. There
is an interval while cakes and wine are passed through
the lodges and loaves are thrown among the plebeians.
Most duels seem decidedly similar, but each is followed
with undiminishing delight. The ladies no less than
their brothers and husbands grasp all the niceties of the
contests&mdash;the methods whereby each champion holds
his lance and shield and controls his horse are wisely
discussed by a hundred pairs of pretty lips. Between
each tilt the heralds, besides praising the valor of the
next pair of combatants, keep up their cries, "Largesse,
gallant knights! Largesse!" and now one, now another
baron rises in the lodges to fling coins among villeins
(whose rough scrambling causes much merriment), or
even to toss money to the heralds themselves&mdash;which
they never hesitate to pick up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contest at the Barriers</div>

<p>Many knights are content with a single passage at
arms, but some who have been successful once tempt
fortune a second time. These are likely to be the professional
champions, and they give remarkable exhibitions
of perfect horsemanship and lance play. As the
afternoon advances, for variation, there is a fight at the
barriers. A stout wooden bar about waist high is set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
across the middle of the lists, and seven knights from
one seigneury and seven from another undertake to cross
the same, while preventing the other party from advancing.
They fight on foot with sword and mace. It
is desperate work; and when at last one party has
forced its way across, four of the defeated side have
broken bones, despite their hauberks, and all-but-broken
heads, despite their helmets.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_242"></a>
  <img src="images/i_242.jpg" width="400" height="486" alt="KNIGHTLY COMBAT ON FOOT" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">KNIGHTLY COMBAT ON FOOT</p>
<p class="center">(From an old print.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

<p>Then a very arrogant baron who has already won three
ransoms determines to increase his wealth. Stationing
himself at the head of the lists, he bids his pursuivant
challenge all comers. There is a long hush. Sire Paul
has made such a trade of his prowess that assuredly
there seems something mercantile about his valor, yet
assuredly he is a terrible man. Suddenly the lodges
begin to cry, "A St. Aliquis!" Sire Aimery himself
(who earlier had broken three lances very neatly with a
friend) is sending down his pursuivant.</p>

<p>All the older knights mutter: "A fearful risk for the
lad! Let him pray to his saints." Conon demands
angrily of Olivier, "Could not you keep back the boy
from this folly?" But does not Heaven favor the young
and brave? Perhaps it is because Sire Paul has let himself
become careless; perhaps because his squire has
forgotten to tighten his saddle girths; perhaps because
St. G√©nevieve cannot allow her votary to undergo disgrace
thus early in his knighthood. In any case, results
confound the wiseacres. "The pitcher that goes too
often to the well is broken," dryly observes Father
Gr√©goire, when at the first course Sire Paul is ignominiously
flung from the saddle. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">H√©!</i> Sire Aimery will now
have more sleeves, girdles, and stockings than can ever
flutter from any one lance, and his kinsfolk are out of
their wits for joy! No victory could ever be more praised
and popular.</p>

<p>So ends the jousting, and that night round St. Aliquis
blaze the great camp fires of the company, all cooking
most hearty suppers (after fasting almost all day), everybody
visiting from tent to tent, fighting the day's
contests over again, condoling with the defeated and
praising the victors. Alliances, both military and matrimonial,
are negotiated between consequential barons;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
the jongleurs produce tricks and songs; there is a great
deal of dancing by the red firelight; and also, one fears,
much hard drinking and most unseemly revelry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Great M√™l√©e</div>

<p>The next day there is the climax to the festival, the
m√™l√©e. Really, it is nothing less than a pitched battle
on a small scale. The details have been arranged at a
council of the more prominent seigneurs at the castle.
About forty knights on a side are to fight under the
leadership of the Viscount of Gemours and the Baron of
Dompierre. The space in the lists is insufficient. They go
to a broad, convenient meadow across the Claire, where
the noncombatants can watch from a safe distance.
The marshals array the two companies "at least a bowshot
apart." Groups of friendly knights are set together
and are placed opposite to groups of rivals with whom
they are anxious to collide. The great banners of the
houses of Gemours and Dompierre flutter in the center
of each respective array,
and all the little
banderoles of the various
knights wave with
them.</p>

<p>When all is ready,
Conon gives the signal,
"Charge them in
God's name!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_244"></a>
  <img src="images/i_244.jpg" width="400" height="200" alt="A COMBAT IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A COMBAT IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY</p>
<p class="center">From the manuscript of Herrade of Landsperg (Schultz).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Each baron is expected
to charge a particular foe, but all are liable to
be swerved in the great rush of men and horses.
The two flashing squadrons of cavalry come together
like thunderbolts. All the danger of the jousts is
present, and another more terrible&mdash;that of being
trampled to death, if once down, by the raging horses.
There is no real leadership. Gemours and Dompierre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
merely try to set examples of valor and to push their
banners forward as rallying points. At first the fighting
is good-humored, but when the lances are broken and
everyone is smiting one another with sword or mace, the
contest becomes desperate. A fearful cloud of dust rises,
almost blinding to the combatants, and rendering their
blows more reckless.</p>

<p>After the fight has progressed some time, certain of
the less adventurous knights begin to drop out. The
squires dive into the murk of warriors and horses and
drag to safety now this, now another fallen cavalier.
At last, just as Conon is considering whether he should
not proclaim a "draw," the Gemours banner is observed
to topple. A desperate attempt is made to right it, but
it sinks again amid a rending shout from the victors.
The uplifted hands fall. The frantic horses are brought
under control. "A Dompierre! A Dompierre!" bawl all
the heralds. And so the m√™l√©e ends.</p>

<p>No one, thanks to excellent armor, is dead, although
one heir to a barony is in a desperate condition and several
shoulders and thighs are broken. It is futile to count the
shattered collar bones and ribs. "A very <em>gentle</em> passage
at arms!" says the Duke to Conon, congratulating his
vassal on the f√™te and its climax. All the other seigneurs
join in similar praises. That night there is another
round of festivities and of visiting. The next dawn the
whole company scatters. The jongleurs' music has
ceased at last. There is no more dancing. After over
two weeks of intensifying gayety St. Aliquis suddenly
returns to sober, normal life.</p>

<p>Alienor, after tearful farewells, departs with her husband
for Burgundy. Aimery rides over to his little
castle at Petitmur, which he will hold as his brother's
vassal. Adela lectures her maids on the need of catching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
up with their weaving, while Conon holds anxious conferences
with his chief provost on the costs of the celebration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vast Expense of Tourneys</div>

<p class="mb2">Doubtless the affair has brought glory to the seigneury.
More than a hundred knights and two hundred squires or
unknighted nobles have attended, along with thousands
of villeins. But how costly have been the furs, drinking
cups and fine weapons presented the guests, the destrers
given the new knights, above all the vast quantity of
provisions devoured! Just God! If Conon had realized
the entire expense he would hardly have embarked on
the whole undertaking. The worst is that the peasants
of the whole barony are so demoralized that it will be
two weeks more ere they return to work. Money must
be borrowed from Jew Simon in Pontdebois to tide over
the crisis. The baron must give up his usual visit to
the king's court at Paris. He must also dismiss certain
cherished schemes of picking a quarrel with the Sire of
Rideau and forcing a private war. Thanks be to Our
Lady, however, Fran√ßois need not be knighted these ten
years, when (being an eldest son) an "aide" can be
levied on all the vassals to help cover the cost.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIV: A Baronial Feud. The Siege of
a Castle.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_247.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">W</span>e have visited St. Aliquis in days of
peace, and at peace the seigneury
remains while we tarry. But peace and
pageants no more deadly than tourneys
are seldom the continuous state of
things. "Rumors of wars" there are
every day; actual wars every few years. Let the saints
be praised if such contests are largely local, are not
bitterly fought out, and are composed before they have
caused worse things than the harrying of certain villages
of helpless, innocent peasants.</p>

<p>In spite of the efforts of clergy and of kings it will be
truthfully written of feudal France that "war was
practically a permanent scourge almost everywhere.
<em>In the society of that day war was the normal
state.</em>" When these wars are waged by mighty kings
one can at least take the comfort that perhaps they are
settling long-standing questions concerning many people,
and, however dreadful, may pave the way for lasting
peace. Such a war has lately found its climax in the
decisive battle of Bouvines, whereof more anon. But
most of the wars are for miserably petty stakes. Time
was when every insignificant sire holding a feeble tower
considered that he had the right to declare war on any
neighbor with whom he argued the rights to a trout
stream. Yet the case is changing. Suzerains are insisting
that the lower class of vassals arbitrate their quarrels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
and not embroil the neighborhood. Nevertheless, the
superior type of barons still claim war as their "noble
right." The amount of local fighting can hardly be
computed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Varieties of Baronial Wars</div>

<p>There is something abnormal about a powerful seigneur
who (if blessed with a long lifetime) does not have
at least <em>one</em> war with each of his several suzerains, a
war with the bishops and abbots with whom he has contact,
a war with each neighboring noble of equal rank,
unless their houses are unwontedly friendly, and a war
with at least some of his own vassals. A war can start
out of a dispute about a bit of land, an ill-defined boundary,
or the exact obligations of a feudal tenure. Theoretically,
the suzerain can interfere between wrangling
vassals. Practically, he had better let them fight it out,
at least till there seems real danger that their fiefs will
be permanently injured. Then he can sometimes compel
a truce.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, God often permits the bitterest
wars to be fought within the fief itself. Sons fight
with fathers&mdash;"the Old Man" will not let his grown boys
rule the seigneury to their liking.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Younger brothers
battle with elder brothers over the inheritance. Nephews
attack uncles who seem prolonging their guardianship.
Sons even attack a widowed mother to seize her
dower lands. These are only some of the things which
make the devil rub his taloned fingers.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, certain limitations are intruding, customs
that have nearly the force of law.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> For example,
if a vassal attacks his suzerain, none but his own family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
(among his noble followers) can aid him. Also, in any
case, at least a week's notice must be given ere the war is
commenced. After the war does begin, forty days'
respite must also be granted your foe's relatives ere
attacking them. In the interval they are entitled to
proclaim their neutrality and so to become safe. Again,
one is supposed to respect priests and women and
minors. Finally, if a truce is made the suzerain is bound
to punish the violators. Such understandings rob warfare
of part of its horrors, but do not prevent infinite
blood and misery.</p>

<p>As for that motive which prevails in other ages for
waging wars&mdash;<em>patriotism</em>&mdash;often it does not seem to
exist so vitally. Certainly Frenchmen ought to make a
common front against Germans, Italians, English, etc.,
but lapses from this obligation are not always condemned
as morally outrageous. Quite recently the Count of
Boulogne, being at odds with King Philip, took money
from both the King of England and the Emperor of
Germany to raise up enemies against the King of France;
and the count evidently felt that this was a proper
measure against an obnoxious suzerain. The great
significant tie is that of <em>personal loyalty</em>.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> It is horrible
to betray the prince to whom you have sworn fealty.
A suzerain will call out his host by a summons to "my
vassals," he will seldom think of appealing to "my fellow
countrymen."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Few Battles and Little Strategy</div>

<p>We have said that wars are incessant; yet there is one
strange thing about them&mdash;<em>pitched battles are very
rare</em>. The campaigns abound in petty skirmishes&mdash;valorous
duels, surprises of small castles, occasional
clashes of cavalry, and, above all, in the pitiless ravaging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
of the lands, farms, and villages of the helpless peasantry.
What better way to put pressure on your foe than to
reduce his villeins to such misery that they can render
him nothing in money or kind and that he thus be brought
to poverty? If you have the weaker force you will not
think of meeting an invader in battle. You will shut
yourself up in your castles when you see the burning
villages, stifle your pride, remain passive, and trust that
after the "forty days' service" of your enemy's vassals is
expired they will weary of the operations and not venture
to besiege your strongholds. Then when the foe's army is
beginning to disperse you can employ some neutral
baron or abbot to negotiate peace.</p>

<p>Even when kings are in the field, with really large
armies, somehow the opposing forces seldom risk a
decisive encounter. They maneuver, skirmish, and
negotiate underhandedly with the uncertain elements in
the hostile camp. The upshot often is that the invading
army, having devoured all the provisions in the open
country and not daring to besiege strong cities with a
powerful enemy close at hand, retreats homeward.</p>

<p>Of course, sometimes there are great battles with great
results. Such in the eleventh century was Senlac, when
Duke William the Norman won all England. Such,
more recently, was the famous day at Bouvines. Such
marked several of the Crusades against the Infidels,
particularly the great and successful First Crusade,
and the Third Crusade, when Richard the Lion Hearted
seemed to come nearer than any other feudal general
to being a really able tactician, if not a great strategist.</p>

<p>These battles are few and far between&mdash;and even the
mighty Richard's ideal style of fighting was rather that
of a headlong cavalier followed by only fifteen knights
and with his ponderous ax hewing a bloody lane through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
a host of Infidels, than that of a careful commander
coolly directing a mighty army. Besides, most of the
wars between second-class barons involve very small
forces. They are only affairs for hundreds. If matters
come to grips, the best captain is he who orders "Advance,
banner bearer! Follow me, vassals!" and leads
the headlong charge.</p>

<p>Enormous pains have been taken in training the individual
warrior. For personal prowess the French
cavalier is as formidable an individual as ever shared the
sins of mankind. But he is trained only in simple
evolutions when maneuvering in companies. He dislikes
taking orders. He wearies of long campaigns. His
camps are very unhygienic and subject to pestilence.
Wars, in short, are to him superb games, exciting, spiced
with danger, and played for large stakes&mdash;which give the
zest; but, save in the Crusades and certain other rare
cases, the higher objects which supply wars with their
sole justification escape him entirely. "Warfare," in
the true scientific sense of the word, is something whereof
your baron is usually in complete ignorance.</p>

<p class="mt2">Earlier in this recital it has been seen that Baron
Conon, soon after he obtained the seigneury, engaged
in a brisk feud with the Viscount of Foretvert. This was
so like many other feuds in the region that it is well to
obtain an authentic history thereof from Father Gr√©goire,
who knows all the circumstances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beginning of a Feud</div>

<p>The origin of the quarrel (he tells us) was commonplace.
Doubtless the viscount had a contemptuous
opinion of his then young and untried neighbor. There
was a wood betwixt the two seigneuries which had been
haltingly claimed by Foretvert; but all through terrible
Baron Garnier's time none but St. Aliquis peasants had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
been suffered to cut fagots there. Now suddenly Huon,
one of the forester's helpers, appeared before Conon in a
piteous plight. His thumbs had been hewn clean off.
He had been chopping timber on the debatable land, had
been seized by the viscount's men, haled before their
master, and the latter had ordered this treatment, adding,
with a grin: "This is the drink penny for touching
a twig in my forests. Tell your young lord to spread
these tidings among his villeins."</p>

<p>When Conon had heard this taunt, his squires trembled
at the workings of his face. Then and there he pulled
out his sword, placed his hands on the hilt, pressing
upon the reliquary, and swore "By God's eyes!"<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> that
he would make the viscount and all the spawn of Foretvert
swallow enough of their own blood to be drunk to
damnation.</p>

<p>"Certes," says Father Gr√©goire, "he could not as a
Christian baron do less; for the lord who lets another
seigneur oppress his villeins is no lord; and if he had
failed to resent such an insult none of his vassals would
have obeyed him."</p>

<p>That same day one of Conon's squires rode to Foretvert.
He bore a "cartel," a bunch of fur plucked from
his master's pelisson.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> He was only a young squire,
but carried his head high. There was some danger in
being such a messenger. The squire had to be as
insolent as possible without actually provoking Foretvert
to violate the protection due to a herald. Into the
great hall of the offending seigneur strode said squire,
carrying a bough of pine in his left hand, the bunch of
fur in the right. His coming had been anticipated. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>greetings, as he was led up to the dais where the viscount
presided, were cold and ceremonious. Then the squire
straightened his slim form and shook out his long mantle.</p>

<p>"Sire Viscount, my master, the Baron of St. Aliquis,
demands of you satisfaction. If you do not make good
the wrongs you have done to him and his, I loyally defy
you in his name."</p>

<p>And down he flung the cartel.</p>

<p>"It is fitting," returned the viscount, mockingly, "a
mere boy should be a squire for a lad. Tell your very
youthful master that I will soon teach him a lesson in
the art of war."</p>

<p>So with a few more such exchanges the squire rode
homeward. Meantime at St. Aliquis things were stirring.
The great bell on the donjon was ringing. Zealous hands
were already affixing the raw hides to the projecting
wooden hoardings upon the battlements. All the storehouses
for weapons in the bailey were being opened for
a distribution of arms. From the armory forge came a
mighty clangor of tightening rivets. The destrers must
have caught the news, they stamped so furiously in the
stables. In the great hall Conon sat with Adela (a
wise head in martial matters), Sire Eustace, and the other
knights in serious debate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mustering the Vassals</div>

<p>Simultaneously, messengers were pricking away to all
the little villages and to the fortalices of the vassals. To
the villeins they cried: "The baron proclaims war with
Foretvert. Bring your cattle and movables near to the
castle for protection." To the vassals they announced,
"Come with all the men you are bound in duty to lead,
seven days from to-day, to St. Aliquis, armed and
provisioned for service; and hereof fail not or we burn
you." This right to burn the dwellings of vassals who
failed to obey the summons to the ban was one of long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
standing in feudal lands. Other messengers proclaimed
the ban by blowing the trumpet at every crossroads in
the barony. To have disobeyed this call would have
been the depth of feudal depravity. None of the vassals
ventured to hesitate. On the contrary, most of them,
like good liegemen, affected to show joy at this chance to
follow their seigneur, crying at once, "My horse! My
horse!" and ordering out all their retainers.</p>

<p>The abbot of the monastery now, as duty bound,
visited both leaders and vainly tried to negotiate peace.
He met with courteous thanks and prompt refusals.
While he was thus squaring with his conscience, Conon
was notifying all his outlying relatives. He was also
sending to several powerful barons who had received
armed assistance from St. Aliquis in the past, and
who were now tactfully reminded of this fact. He likewise
sent an especially acceptable messenger to his
suzerain the duke, to convince the latter that Foretvert
was entirely wrong, and that the duke had better not
interfere. Thanks to this energy and diplomacy, by
the end of the week the whole countryside had been
roused, the peasants had driven most of their cattle
so close to St. Aliquis castle that they could be protected,
and many villeins, deserting their hovels, were camping
in the open (it being fine summer weather) in the space
between the barbican and bailey. As for Conon, with
pride he mustered his "array"&mdash;one hundred knights or
battle worthy squires; two hundred sergeants&mdash;horsemen
of non noble birth; and some seven hundred footmen&mdash;villeins
with long knives, pikes, arbalists, big axes,
etc.&mdash;of no great value in open battle, but sure to have
their place in other work ahead.</p>

<p>From Foretvert reports came in of similar preparation.
But the viscount had quarreled with some of his relations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
He had broken a promise he once made to help a certain
sire in a feud. His immediate vassals responded to his
call, but they felt that their lord ought to have consulted
them ere provoking St. Aliquis so grossly. In a word,
their zeal was not of the greatest.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the viscount, an impetuous and self-confident
man, having hastily assembled his forces, the
very day the week of intermission ended invaded Conon's
territory. He expected to find his enemy's peasants still
in the fields and the St. Aliquis retainers in the process
of mustering. To his amazement, he discovered that the
villages were almost empty and most of the cattle driven
away. Nevertheless, he foolishly allowed his men to
scatter in order to ravage everything left at their mercy.
Soon hayricks were burning, standing crops were being
trampled down, and the thatch on the forsaken huts was
blazing. Here and there troopers were driving before
their spears oafish peasants who had lingered too long.
The hands of these wretches were tied behind their
backs. Beside them trudged their weeping wives and
children. Every sheep, pig, and chicken discoverable
was, of course, seized.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The ravagers soon had enough
booty to load their horses to such a degree that one of
Foretvert's more experienced knights warned him his
men were becoming dangerously encumbered in case of
an encounter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Passage at Arms</div>

<p>The viscount laughed at these fears, yet was about to
sound trumpets to recall the foraging parties; when, lo!
down a wood road, through a forest that had been
imperfectly scouted, came charging the whole St. Aliquis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>levy, with Conon's great banner racing on ahead. Half
of the viscount's men were dispersed; the other half
barely got into a kind of order when their enemies were
upon them, thrusting, slashing, and laying about like
fiends. Such being the case, Foretvert had cause to bless
the Virgin that he got safely from the field. He only did
so because his squire most gallantly stabbed the horse of
Sire Eustace just as he was closing with the viscount.
The squire himself was brained by the seneschal's
mace an instant later. Five of the Foretvert knights
were slain outright, despite their armor. Four more
were pulled from their horses and dragged off as prisoners
for ransom.</p>

<p>Of the foraging parties, the leaders got home by
putting their horses at speed, but the miserable footmen
were intercepted by scores. Many of these were slain
while dropping their sinful booty. About forty were
taken prisoners, but, being only villeins (from whom
no ransom was to be expected), Conon promptly hanged
ten as a warning against further ravaging of his lands,
and took the other thirty back to his castle to be hanged
later in case this first hint should not prove effective.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>This unusually decisive engagement ought, in the
opinion of many, to have ended the war. Conon now
invaded the Foretvert domains and with proper precautions
sent out <em>his</em> ravaging parties, who soon taught
their foes a lesson as to how to devastate a countryside.
But the viscount, although sorely shaken and deserted
now by many, arrogantly refused to make those concessions
which Conon declared "his honor required ere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>he could think of peace." The war thus promised not
to terminate until, by incessant raids and counter-raids,
the peasants of both seigneuries had been brought
to the edge of starvation.</p>

<p>The viscount, of course, reckoned that at the end of
their ordinary "forty days' service" Conon's vassals and
allies would leave him. Most feudal levies were wont
thus to melt away, after a very short campaign, and
leave their leader bereft of almost all save his immediate
retainers. Foretvert could then regather his men and
resume the contest. But the saints so ordered it that
Conon had been a thrifty seigneur as well as a popular
suzerain and neighbor. He now offered his allies and
vassals good deniers if they would serve until the autumn
rains. He also hired the services of some fifty
horsemen and two hundred footmen, led from Lorraine
by an iron-handed soldier of fortune, Ritter Rainulf of the
Moselle, who would put his German mercenaries at the
beck of about any baron offering good silver. Mercenaries
did not serve for "forty days," but for as
many months as they received steady wages&mdash;a great
advantage.</p>

<p>Conon likewise hired a base-born fellow, Ma√Ætre
Jer√¥me. The knights complained that the baron gave
him too great pay and confidence, but Ma√Ætre Jer√¥me had
been one of the king's best engineers in the siege of the
great castle, Ch√¢teau Gaillard, on the Seine, when
Philip Augustus took that supposedly impregnable
fortress from John of England in 1204. Now the castle
of Foretvert itself was almost as strong as St. Aliquis,
and no siege thereof was worth considering. But the
viscount had a smaller fortalice, Tourfi√®re, which lay
closer to Conon's lands and was not so formidable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Siege of a Castle</div>

<p>Tourfi√®re consisted merely of a single curtain of walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
around the courtyard of a central keep, with, of course, a
palisaded barbican before the gate. There was a moat,
but not deep, and flooded only in wet weather, and the
foundations of this stronghold did not rest, apparently,
on solid rock&mdash;a matter upon which Ma√Ætre Jer√¥me laid
great stress after a discreet reconnaissance. Suddenly,
to the amazement of many, Conon with all his forces
appeared before Tourfi√®re and summoned its castellan,
Sire Gauthier, the viscount's nephew, to surrender&mdash;a
demand refused with derision.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_259"></a>
  <img src="images/i_259.jpg" width="400" height="562" alt="A CATAPULT" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A CATAPULT</p>
<p class="center">A sort of sling which one tightened
with the aid of a windlass and
which threw heavy projectiles.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sire Gauthier commanded some twenty knights,
squires or sergeants, also at least ninety armed villeins&mdash;a
sufficient force, it seemed, for a small castle, especially
as the women in the place could drop stones, throw down
burning pitch hoops, pour boiling water, and help twist
back the casting engines. The defenders thus prepared
to resist with energy, confident that Conon could not
keep his heterogeneous levies together much longer and
that the siege would break up ignominiously. But,
despite his villein blood, Ma√Ætre Jer√¥me ordered the
siege in a marvelously skillful manner. No chess player
could have moved his pieces better than did he. First
he persuaded the baron to resist his impulse to attempt
the walls by a sudden rush with scaling ladders, pointing
out that Gauthier, besides his arbalists, had four great
trenchbuts (stone-hurlers worked by counterweights)
and also two catapults, giant bows mounted on standards
and able to send a heavy arrow clean through a
man in full armor.</p>

<p>"We must take Tourfi√®re by the crowbar and spade,
and not by the sword, fair Seigneur," said <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Jerome'">Jer√¥me</ins>,
smilingly; whereupon a great levy of Conon's serfs
began cutting timber and building a palisade all around
the besieged castle, to stop sorties or succoring parties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
Meantime Jer√¥me was directing the making of trenchbuts
and catapults for the besiegers. With these they
soon smashed the wooden hoardings which had protected
the battlements, making it impossible for the garrison
to mount the walls, save at a few places or in great
emergencies, lest they be
picked off by the attackers'
arbalists. The trenchbuts
also cast small kegs of
"Greek fire" (a compound
of pitch, sulphur, and
naphtha) inside the castle
court. These terrible fire
balls could not be quenched
by water, but only by sand.
By desperate efforts, indeed,
the defenders prevented
decisive harm, but
some of the buildings in the
courtyard were burned and
Sire Gauthier's men became
wearied in their efforts to
fend off disaster.</p>

<p>In bravado the defenders
took two prisoners and hanged them on the highest
tower. Conon retaliated by immediately hanging four
prisoners just out of bowshot of the castle, and causing
his largest trenchbut to fling a dead horse clear over
the battlements and into the court. Meantime a remarkable
energy of the assailants, just outside their palisades,
was observable by Sire Gauthier. The castellan took
counsel with his most experienced men, for the besiegers
seemed shaping very many timbers.</p>

<p class="center">(From Viollet-Le-Duc); the moat has

</div>
</div>

<p>His advisers were divided in opinion. Some said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Conon was planning to build a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">beffroi</i>. This was a most
ambitious undertaking ordinarily used only in great
sieges. A <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">beffroi</i> was a movable tower built of heavy
timbers and raised to at
least the height of the
wall attacked. Its front
was covered by rawhides
to repel arrows and fire-balls.
It was worked
forward on rollers or
clumsy wheels until close
to the hostile parapet.
Then, when almost
touching, a swinging
bridge from the summit
was flung across to the
wall, a host of assailants
swarmed up a ladder in
the rear and over the
bridge to the battlements.
The defenders
then needed all their
valor to keep their castle
from speedy capture.</p>

<p>Others in the garrison,
however, derided the idea
that a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">beffroi</i> was projected. It would be winter ere such
a complicated structure could be completed. They said
that the baron was preparing battering rams and a
"cat." The battering ram was simply a heavy timber
with a metal head, swung by chains from a kind of
wooden trestle. Set up close under a wall it was pulled
back and forth by ropes, and by repeated blows knocked
down the masonry. The "cat" was a long, narrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
tent-shaped structure of heavy timbers covered with
hides or iron to turn missiles from the parapets. One end
of this was built out until it came into contact with
the walls, when skillful miners under its protection
quarried their way through the masonry with pickaxes.</p>

  <span class="caption">A MANTELET IN WOOD</span>
</div>

<p>These methods were easier
to prepare than the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">beffroi</i>,
although not so effective.
The defenders felt sure they
would be used when the
attackers were seen making
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mantelets</i>, large wooden
shields mounted on small
wheels, to protect the crossbowmen
when they crept up
to clear the walls&mdash;a needful
preliminary to advancing either the cat or the ram. Their
certainty increased when one night, by a sudden rush,
Conon's men stormed through the weak palisade of the
barbican and, forcing their way near to the walls, began
filling up the moat with <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fascines</i>&mdash;bundles of fagots. By
using his trenchbuts and catapults to best advantage,
Sire Gauthier felt confident, however, that he had prevented
them from leveling the moat sufficiently to make
a firm foundation for siege engines. The Tourfi√®re men,
therefore, shouted arrogantly: "Take your time, St.
Aliquis hirelings! Your 'Madame Cat' will never gnaw
our rats."<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Presently, after a couple of weeks, the besiegers were
seen in great activity, as if arraying themselves for an
assault. Gauthier was convinced they were about, in
desperation, to try to scale his walls with ladders. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
of a sudden a panic-stricken sergeant ran up to his watchtower.
Wafts of smoke were escaping near the foundations
of the curtain wall near the gate!</p>

<p class="center">At the top of the wall the scaffolding

</div>
</div>

<p>Gauthier instantly realized what had happened, but
it was too late. Under an elaborate feint with other
preparations, Ma√Ætre Jer√¥me had taken advantage of
the soft ground beneath the
castle and had driven a mine,
beginning at a safe distance
in the rear and cunningly concealing
the entrance and the
earth excavated until it was
fairly under a vital section of
the wall. Then a large chamber
had been cleared and
wooden posts soaked with tallow
had been put under the
masonry to keep it from falling
on the miners. As the last of
them retreated, a torch was
set to the woodwork, the
whole chamber having been
crammed with inflammables.
Presently the fire ate away the posts. With a thundering
crash a vital section of the wall collapsed.</p>

<p>The besieged had not realized the situation in time to
drive a countermine or to erect a second wall inside the
danger point. The moment the St. Aliquis men saw the
wall topple they rushed forward. The defenders met
them bravely in the breach and there was bloody
swordplay, but the thrust of numbers was irresistible.
Gauthier and part of his men fled, indeed, to the donjon
and barred the entrance, but they were utterly demoralized.
All the women and children, packed into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
tower, were shrilly lamenting the dead and were otherwise
frantic. Most of the provisions had been in a storehouse
outside the donjon. The end, therefore, was certain.
At the end of the next day the garrison in the
donjon surrendered on promise of life and limb for all,
and courteous treatment for the knights.</p>

<p class="mb2">The storming of Tourfi√®re ended the war. Conon
might, indeed, have ruined Foretvert utterly, but now
the duke intervened. It was not for his interests to
have any vassal rendered unfit to meet his feudal
obligations. Conon, however, was able to exact very
high terms. For evacuating Tourfi√®re he obtained the
cession of a village whose peasants paid very large dues,
and two of the viscount's best vassals also transferred
their homage to St. Aliquis. The contending parties
swore to peace upon the most precious relics at the abbey,
and exchanged the kiss of amity. Henceforth Foretvert,
a sadder and wiser seigneur, has been outwardly friendly
with his powerful neighbor and even came as a sulky
guest to Alienor's wedding.</p>

<h2>Chapter XV: A Great Feudal Battle&mdash;Bouvines.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_264.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">S</span>o ended the feud between St. Aliquis and
Foretvert&mdash;a less exhausting and more
decisive baronial war than were many,
and causing correspondingly less misery
to the helpless peasants. But it has
also been Conon's fortune to fight in a
really great battle, one that will hereafter be set down
among the most famous engagements in the annals of
France.</p>

<p class="mt2">It is a sunny afternoon. Young Fran√ßois and Anseau
have wearied of hunting frogs beside the outer moat.
Under the garden trees, Sire Eustace, tough old warrior,
is meditating over a pot of hippocras. They demand
of him once more the story of "the battle." For them
there is only one battle&mdash;Bouvines. The seneschal,
ever the slave of his youthful masters, after suitable
urgings, begins.</p>

<p>"Now you must know, my fair damoisieux, that all
this took place six years since, in the year 1214, upon
the seven-and-twentieth day of July. For our sins it
was extremely hot that season, so that all of us have,
I trust, obtained some remission from purgatory. God
grant that next time we have a great battle it be in
the pleasant spring or autumn, though otherwise the
saints showed to us French a great mercy. But now
to commence.</p>

<p>"That year King John of England, having, by his evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
rule and folly lost nearly all his Anjou and Norman lands
to our good King Philip, sent large money and skillful
ambassadors into Flanders and Germany to stir up
trouble. The great counts of Flanders and Boulogne
nursed grievances against their liege lord our king, and
to them joined many other seigneurs of those parts,
notably the Dukes of Brabant and Limburg, the Count
of Holland, and chiefest of all the German Emperor
Otto IV himself, who came with a huge levy of Saxons.
With those rode the English Earl of Salisbury with a
great band of Flemish mercenaries who took King
John's ill-gained penny. Never since Duke Charles
Martel smote back the Paynym had so terrible a host
menaced our gentle France; and when at last, in July,
the whole array under Emperor Otto came together at
Valenciennes to take the road to Paris, even brave
knights trembled for the king and kingdom.</p>

<p>"Never had the call for the royal ban and rear ban
gone out more urgently than that summer. The king's
messenger came to St. Aliquis with the 'brief of summons'
bidding Messire Conon ride with every man and lad
that could stride a horse or trudge with a spear; and so
went the command through all North France. But in
the south country John was making a formidable diversion
from his remaining dominions in Gascony, and we
of the Languedoil lands had to meet the northern shock
alone.</p>

<p>"When Messire your Father received the summons,
there was even greater furbishing than when old Foretvert
defied us. Sire Conon had in the abbot and wrote
his last wishes, arranged that if he fell he should be
buried in the abbey church by the altar where St.
Bernard had once said mass, and he left to the monks
five hundred livres in return for perpetual masses for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
his soul. The remainder of us made vows according to
ability. I say nothing of the parting, or how your
mother bravely promised to guard the castle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mobilization of Feudal Army</div>

<p>"So the ban was answered all through the land, and
the king's great host came together. Never again shall
I see so fine a mustering of knights as gathered at
Peronne. It far surpassed any tournament. Every
hour the banners came in, to the sound of tabors, horns,
and drums. There was an enormous baggage train, so
that I believe there were more mules than horses, for
many barons brought their great tents, with many
coffers of extra arms and fine clothing. In the rear were
gathered a second array of jongleurs, peddlers and very
evil women, whom not all the commands of the king,
somehow, could disperse. Verily in that army there
were twice as many mouths to fill as there were men to
fight; likewise, short as was the campaign, there was
much sickness, thanks to bad food, bad water, and, so
certain even averred, to overmuch filth. The comfort was
that in Otto's camp matters were, if anything, much worse.</p>

<p>"In any case those tumultuous days of assemblage
were soon at an end. Tidings came that the Germans
and Flemings were advancing, and on the twenty-fifth
of July we marched into Tournai on the edge of Flanders.
Messire Conon, who was at the royal council-tent,
told me that the king's barons debated as to the purpose
of the enemy. Would he offer fair battle in the plain
near Cambrai, as we much desired, or would he strive to
slip past our army and go straight toward Paris? I
have been told of books concerning the ancient Roman
captains, Julius C√¶sar and his peers, and it would seem
as if to them the moving of armies had been a business
of deep sagacity, advancing your columns by careful
rules, somewhat as you move your men on a gaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
board. No one, however, is so sage as that to-day, and
I think it was either mere fortune or (speaking as a
Christian) the kind St. Denis, who guards our beautiful
France, that brought the hosts together when and where
they presently came.</p>

<p>"It was at break of day on that seven-and-twentieth
of July that we quitted Tournai, intending to pass the
little river Marque, to get to the town of Bouvines and
thereby to be covered by certain marshes so we might
be protected from surprise, and yet be able to strike the
foe's rear if he should take the road to Paris. But Otto
and his lords, swollen with their German and Fleming
pride and confident in their great host of infantry, were
determined to attack, and so kept hard after us. It is
only nine miles from Tournai to Bouvines, but our long
trains of baggage crawled along like snails. Therefore
it was almost noon when the sumpter mules and the
infantry had crossed the bridge. We of the cavalry
were still on the nearer side, covering the march, when
our scouts came racing in. 'The Germans! The Germans!'
And there assuredly, over the rolling slopes
of the cornfields beyond Bouvines, we saw the long lines
of horsemen flying in a great dust cloud.</p>

<p>"Now there was with the king the Bishop Garin of
Senlis. He was an old knight hospitaler, one of those
holy brethren who, despite churchly vows, rejoice to
fight in just causes, and Bishop Garin at once clapped
spurs to his destrer to reconnoiter. Soon he dashed back,
having discovered quite enough. He found our Lord
Philip sitting under an ash tree close to the bridge
eating dinner, with many great nobles, Messire Conon
among them, sitting on the grass. 'Tidings, fair Sire!'
cried Garin. 'The Germans will fight. Their knights
are in panoply, and behind them march the infantry!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle Array at Bouvines</div>

<p>"It was no pleasant moment for the king. His own
infantry were beyond the river, but his cavalry were on
this side. He could not get his horsemen across the
single bridge without grievous loss; but there was,
perchance, still time to bring back the foot. Therefore,
with what speed we might, every man of us fell into the
array, and some brave sergeants of Champagne made
such charges upon Otto's vanguard that, though outnumbered
and pressed back, they delayed the foe
until our men could take their places and present a
gallant front. As for the attackers, when they saw that
we were ready to do battle, like prudent men they
halted and arrayed their own lines. So for an hour
both sides waited, just out of bowshot, many of us
very nervous and cursing the delay&mdash;the more as the
sun beat down pitilessly&mdash;although the more pious
confessed hastily to the priests, who were always moving
up and down the files, or at least we said our <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mea
culpas</i> for our sins.</p>

<p>"Presently you could see the whole array of the enemy
spread out like some fair picture on a long tapestry.
On their right, facing our Counts of Ponthieu and Dreux,
were the mercenaries under Salisbury, and the men of
that foul traitor Boulogne. On their left were the long
lines of Flemish horsemen over against our cavaliers of
Champagne and Burgundy. But we from Quelqueparte,
with so many other companies, were in the center
battle where flew King Philip's great oriflamme, a
mighty scarlet banner of samite, surrounded by chosen
cavaliers. We horsemen were in the rear. In front of
us spread the French footmen&mdash;the burgher levies of
the towns who answered the king's summons. 'Shame
that burghers should stand before knights!' cried some
of us; but the King and Bishop Garin, who seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
to know everything, understood their business, as you
will see.</p>

<p>"It is told that just before the hosts charged King
Philip prayed aloud before his bodyguard: 'Lord, I
am but a man, but I am also a king. Thine it is to guard
the king. Thou wilt lose nothing thereby. Wherever
thou wouldst go, I will follow thee!' Also I heard that
close behind the king there stood, as long as he might,
the royal chaplain, William the Breton, who all through
the battle, with another clerk, kept singing psalms
such as 'Blessed be the Lord my strength, who teacheth
my hands to war and my fingers to fight.' But Bishop
Garin sang no psalms. Up and down the lines of horsemen
he rode, thundering: 'Extend yourselves, lest the
enemy outflank you. One knight should not make
another his shield!' So he put all our knights in the
first line of the cavalry. In the rear lines he put the
mounted sergeants. We had perhaps two thousand
knights and five thousand sergeants. Our infantry were
over five-and-twenty thousand, but the foe had even
more footmen than we, though their horse was a little
inferior. Thus the battle was very fair, two lines of
men and horses a mile and a half long, and the fields
smooth and open enough for a jousting. There never
was better place for an honorable battle.</p>

<p>"After we had sat in our saddles a long time, thinking
of our sins and admiring in a fearsome way the splendor
of the great press of the foe opposite, a party of our
sergeants suddenly charged out on our right against the
Flemings. Their attack was too weak, and the Flemings
drove them back and charged in return, their leaders
crying, 'Think on your ladies!' as if in a courteous
m√™l√©e. Whereat, nothing loath, our Burgundian and
Champagnois knights dashed out on them, and long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
engaged in an uncertain battle, every cavalier selecting
a foe and riding against him. Here one side prevailed
and here another, and some warriors even dropped to
the rear to recover breath and tighten harness, then
spurred back to the charge. For a little while we of
the center watched them thus; then nearer things
engrossed us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defeat of the French Infantry</div>

<p>"I have told you that King Philip and his footmen,
as well as many of our knights, held the center battle.
Facing them was the dense array of Flemish and German
infantry, with Emperor Otto himself, accompanied by
chosen horsemen, in their rear, and we could see in the
middle press the great imperial banner, a silken dragon,
white and green, raised upon a pole capped with a
golden eagle. It was not borne by a cavalier but flew
from a tall car drawn by four horses. As we gazed at
this vast hostile array, lo! the whole mass seemed
surging forward against our infantry. Never was there
a sight like it, spear points, hauberks, and helmets all
flashing in the sun. The ground shook with the trample
of thousands of feet. Countless war horns sounded, and
we heard the deep '<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Hoch! Hoch!</i>' of the German infantry
coming down on us like thunder.</p>

<p>"Then the emperor's great masses struck our footmen
from the communes. Doubtless our poor knaves meant
bravely, and always had plenty of courage when defending
their walls, but never would France and King
Philip have been saved by townsmen. Soon we saw all
those base-born infantry breaking toward the rear, and
for a moment our skies looked black. But, 'Open the
ranks,' called Messire Conon and our other leaders, 'and
let the villeins run through.' So we opened the lines in
the cavalry and let these timid friends escape. Then
came a last tightening of buckles and pushing down of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
helms. Right before us, thousands upon thousands,
were surging the emperor's infantry. All together we
raised the glad '<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Montjoie St. Denis!</i>'<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> the royal battle
cry of France. Whereupon followed such a coursing
as never in all my life I can hope again to see. With
our eyes on Otto's great banner, straight into that press
of Germans and Flemings we French cavaliers rode
like mad, the knights in front and all the squires and
good sergeants raging behind us. The horses knew
their hour. They flew at speed with no touch of spur.
Though I am blessed with all the joys of paradise,
never, after ten thousand years of bliss, shall I forget
the wondrous rapture I felt when we struck that hostile
line!"</p>

<p>(Sire Eustace's eyes are gleaming now like sparks of
fire. Fran√ßois and Anseau are hardly breathing as he
speaks).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charge of the French Knights</div>

<p>"Through that caitiff infantry we went as a hot
knife cleaves through cheese. I had the St. Aliquis
banner, and kept close behind Messire Conon with
all our men hallooing and smiting behind. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">H√©!</i> what
chance had those villein footmen against <em>gentle</em> Frenchmen,
who all had known horses and lance since they
ceased from mother's milk? So one and all we charged,
and, like castles rising out of the plain, soon you could
see here, there, and yonder the banners and squadrons
of our cavaliers on their tall horses, looming above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
the snarling, striking footmen, who closed in all around
them, and yet could not keep our knights from charging
forward, always forward.</p>

<p>"After that, all the battle was broken up. For when
Emperor Otto and his knights saw their infantry being
cut down like sheep, they also charged, giving us the
honest joy of crossing swords with men of nobility.
So for a long time it was horse to horse and man to man.
You have heard the jongleurs tell of the great deeds
done. But as for us of St. Aliquis, just as we were close
to hewing our way clear through the whole German
line, lo! a great shouting rose on our left&mdash;"The King!
The King!" And we saw the royal standard being
tossed up and down, as in distress, by Sire Wado de
Montigny, who bore it. Then back we charged, with
many cavaliers more&mdash;just in time. For King Philip,
while attacking gallantly like any other knight, had
been separated from most of his friends, and a swarm
of knavish Flemish pikemen had striven to drag him
from his horse. His good armor turned their pikes,
yet a soldier caught the hook of a halberd in the chain
mail round his throat and pulled him to the ground.
But the king sprang up as briskly as a young squire,
and all the French knights at hand spurred to his aid.
Then it was that Sire Peter Tristen leaped from his own
horse and mounted his lord upon it; and Messire Conon,
being among the very first to ride up and scatter or
trample the Flemings, later received no small praise
and thanks.</p>

<p>"Therefore, in that part of the field God prospered
us; and then came the signal mercy when Emperor
Otto fled the field. For as our knights charged and his
cavaliers gave way, our men slew Otto's horse, and
when he fell they almost seized the emperor. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
his Saxons, selling their lives right dearly, got him another
horse. But herein was the German emperor different from
our good French king. For when Philip was remounted
again he raised once more his clear '<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Montjoie St.
Denis!</i>' and pressed the charge; but Otto (nigh out of
his wits, perhaps, and somewhat wounded) fled from
the field with only three knights, leaving his great banner
and all his brave vassals to their fate; and they say he
never drew rein till he reached Valenciennes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rout of the Germans and Flemings</div>

<p>"The German knights, though deserted, still fought
bravely, but the Netherlanders and Flemings soon were
fleeing in droves. Besides, on the two wings of the
conflict we Frenchmen were already proving victorious
and from right and left our knights were charging in to
help the center, cutting their way so far to the rear
that when at last the German cavaliers knew that all
was lost, and now began to flee, they often found themselves
surrounded and were pulled from their horses and
so made captive.</p>

<p>"Thus ended the day's work, save on the right wing
of the enemy. Here had fought the great rebel Reginald
of Boulogne, who knew there was naught left for him
save victory or ruin. He formed some seven hundred
Brabantine infantry into a circle. With their pikes
and axes they beat off for long the charges of our cavaliers.
From behind this living wall Boulogne, with a
few brave knights, time and again charged out, performing
high deeds of valor, and then, as it were, retreating
into their fortress to get breath. But now that the
remainder of the field was cleared, King Philip brought
up his whole power of cavalry. He formed three thousand
of us into three great columns of mounted men
and, charging in on every side, by sheer weight we broke
the Brabantine circle down. So we dragged the Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
of Boulogne from his horse, fighting to the last, and the
king holds him close prisoner unto this day.</p>

<p>"This was the last m√™l√©e of a battle the like whereof
has not been in France these many years. Of course, the
slaughter of the footmen was great, some thousands of
both ours and theirs. The field was a sorry sight that
evening and the groans of the dying rang in my ears,
for all that we were so happy. But it pleased the saints
that, thanks to good armor, we cavaliers got off quite
safely. I have heard that 'only three French knights
were slain,' although I am sure that number is too few.
Of the Germans and Flemings they say one hundred
and seventy knights were killed outright; but better
still, we took five German counts, twenty-five barons,
and some hundred and six lesser knights as prisoners.
It was the ransom of that Baron of Imgerfels whom we
unhorsed which presently went far to pay for your
aunt's wedding and uncle's knighting.</p>

<p>"As for the manner in which we all returned to Paris
joyous as the angels, and how the church bells rang
and all the fat burghers hung the streets with tapestry,
and with the clergy and scholars in the university we had
seven days of illuminations, feastings, and rejoicings,
which is a story repeated every day. But there will
never be another Bouvines."</p>

<p class="mt2">So spoke the seneschal. If we would comment on
his narrative, we would say that Philip manifestly
conquered because his very unepiscopal chief of staff,
Bishop Garin, drew up his army with greater skill than
Otto's leaders arranged the German-Fleming host, and
also because when at last the hosts engaged in a series
of innumerable duels, the French knights on the average
proved superior. King Philip, after the fight was started,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
showed himself a valiant cavalier personally, but hardly
figured as a commander. Otto contributed to shake the
morale of his men by premature flight, but his great
host of footmen were almost worthless, despite their
pikes and halberds, against the terrific shock of the
French cavalry, charging on perfectly smooth ground,
where mailed horsemen could fight at their best. Missile
weapons played no part. When the English yew bow
shall appear, the situation may change. Till then the
mounted knight, in all his ponderous armor, charging
with lance at rest or with his great sword dancing in
his hands, will appear as the monarch of the battlefields.
Bouvines has marked the apog√©e of the feudal cavalry.</p>

In feudal battles, armies often used merely the names of their
leaders, "<i>Burgundy!</i>" "<i>Coucy!</i>" "<i>Bourbon!</i>" etc. But many
regions had a special war cry. Thus the Normans cried "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Dex ais!</i>"
the Bretons, "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Malo! Malo!</i>" the Angevins "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Val√©e!</i>" Imperialists
were likely to cry "<i>Rome!</i>" and Crusaders "<i>Holy Sepulcher!</i>"
To "cry one's ensign" was a great object in all medi√¶val battles.</p></div></div>

<h2>Chapter XVI: The Life of the Peasants.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_278.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">T</span>hus have been seen Messire Conon and
his familiars in their pleasures, feasts,
and wars. The gentle folk seem to
monopolize all the life of the barony.
Yet at best they number scarce one in
a hundred of all the Christians who dwell
therein. Assuredly the poor and humble seem much less
interesting and command less attention. They have
no splendors, no picturesque f√™tes or feuds. A life of
monotonous poverty seldom detains the chronicler;
nevertheless, it is time to visit the village of huts
so often seen spreading beyond the bridge to the west
of the castle.</p>

<p>The St. Aliquis peasants are told that they have
naught whereof to complain. They have a kindly
seigneur who "renders justice." Since the Foretvert
feud, no war has ravaged them. The saints of late have
sent neither short crops nor pestilence. To repine
against their lot is ingratitude toward God.</p>

<p>There is abundant class consciousness in the Feudal
Ages. Clerks, knights, peasants&mdash;every man knows to
which of the three great categories of humanity he
belongs, and acts accordingly.</p>

<p>A monkish preacher<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> pictures the world as a vast
body whereof the clerics are the eyes, for they show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
to all men the way to safety; the noble knights the hands
and arms, for God orders them to protect the Church
and the weak and to promote peace and justice; finally
the common people (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">minores</i>) form the lower parts of
the body&mdash;it is their business to nourish the eyes and
limbs. More bluntly still, as long ago as about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1000, Bishop Adelberon of Laon had divided mankind
into two great divisions&mdash;first, the clergy who prayed
and the seigneurs who fought; second, the toilers;
adding that "to furnish all with gold, food, and raiment&mdash;such
is the obligation of the servile class."</p>

<p>Since these classes are clearly ordained of Heaven, to
rebel against one's status is manifestly questioning the
justice of Providence&mdash;a damnable impiety.</p>

<p>Few of the St. Aliquis peasants ever dream of being
anything but villeins. They regard gentlefolk somewhat
as good Christians regard angels&mdash;as beings of
another sphere. All they hope for is kindly treatment
and modest prosperity within the limits providentially
assigned them. Therefore, they are not too unhappy.</p>

<p class="mt2">If we go up and down France we shall find the rural
population decidedly dense.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> One little village usually
follows another closely and every collection of huts
swarms with human bipeds. There are, indeed, vast
forests and marshes which might with better management
be put under the plow, but the extent of arable
land is great. Heaven surely loves the peasants, it has
made so many of them. Seemingly their number is
limited merely by the question of food supply.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Danger of Great Famines</div>

<p>If the condition of the peasantry often seems bad,
it is comforting to know that for the last two centuries
it has been improving. Not for many years have matters
in the St. Aliquis region been as they were in some parts
of France during the terrible famine of 1030-32. At
that time we are told that the poor devoured grass, roots
and even white clay. Their faces were pale, their
bodies lean, their stomachs bloated, "their voices thin
and piping like the voice of birds." Wolves came out
of forests and fed on children. Strangers and travelers
were liable to be waylaid in solitary spots and killed
simply that they might be eaten. Near Macon a "hermit"
at last was seized who had lured wayfarers to
share the hospitality of his cell. The skulls of forty-eight
victims were there discovered, after which they
burned the wretch alive.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">GROUP OF PEASANTS AND OF SHEPHERDS</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>You can go on multiplying stories about famines&mdash;how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
human flesh at times was sold in markets; how
starving children were lured by the offers of a bit of
food to places where ghouls could kill and feast on them;
how a measure of corn rose to sixty sous in gold; and
how even the very rich "lost their color." These days,
thanks be to the saints, seem disappearing; yet the
danger of pinching hard times is still a real one, even
in fortunate St. Aliquis.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The peasants of Messire Conon are free. The serfs
of the barony had been manumitted about a hundred
years earlier, by a baron who (after an extremely iniquitous
life) was admonished on his deathbed by his
confessor that he must do something extraordinary for
the salvation of his soul.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> As a result the St. Aliquis
peasants were no longer bound to the soil and could
quit the seigneury&mdash;as serfs assuredly could not do.
They could also marry any women they wished without
asking their lord's consent or paying him a fee. They
could bequeath their goods without having him sequester
an outrageous part. All this, of course, improved their
status, yet they were still subject to numerous imposts
in money and kind, and to various forms of forced
labor. Although they had now the legal right to quit
the barony, only with the greatest difficulty could they
sell their little farms and chattels thereon, so they could
take a decent share of their possessions elsewhere; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>if they wandered to distant parts, the local authorities
were likely to call them "masterless men" and assume
that if they had forsaken their old lord they must
somehow be criminals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exploitation of Villeins</div>

<p>Nevertheless, it is much better to be a free peasant
than a serf. The majority of the French lower classes
are now becoming free, although in other Christian
lands, notably Germany, serfage will prevail for a weary
day hereafter.</p>

<p>But even though one becomes free, he is a villein
still. The taint of ignoble blood clings like a shirt of
pitch, even after achieving prosperity and wealth.
Knightly opinion is expressed by that great troubadour,
Bertran de Born: "I love to see the rich churl in distress
if he dares to strive with nobles. I love to see him beg
his bread in nakedness."</p>

<p>Even a well-disposed lord looks on a peasant largely
as a source of income. In time of peace the taxes
and forced labor squeezed out of him yield that which
presently turns into destrers, silvered hauberks, furs,
hawks, fair dames' luxuries, dowries, adubbements,
tourneys. In time of war he exists to be pillaged and
massacred, in order to impoverish his master by ruining
the latter's revenues. The burghers of the towns are
a little more respected. Their industrial products are
needful. They can better protect themselves. But
the richest syndic of a commune cannot really hold up
his head socially with the unknighted bachelor who
drags out life in a tumble-down manor house.</p>

<p>At every turn the peasant finds himself exploited.
He must pay a direct tax supposedly proportioned to
the size and yield of his farm. That is only the beginning.
When his wife has bread to bake, it must be taken to
the lord's oven. One loaf in so many goes as the fee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
The flour must be ground up in the lord's mill&mdash;again
for a fee. The grapes must be pressed out in the lord's
winepress. The sheep must be driven into the lord's
sheepfold every night, that he may get the manure.
Every dispute must be arbitrated before the lord's provost
or the great man himself&mdash;more fees. In short, the
whole r√©gime aims to compel the peasant to go to his
seigneur for everything he needs, so that he will have
extremely little business to transact away from the
seigneury. Doubtless it is a convenience often to find
things commonly needful always at hand. There is a
certain return for many of the exactions. But the
seigneur does not act out of benevolence. If the peasants
wish, for example, to set up their own ovens, they must
pay the seigneur the equivalent of the baker's fees of
which he is deprived. If they then wish to bake their
own bread, he is now quite indifferent.</p>

<p>Besides the imposts and numerous fees (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">banalit√©s</i>)
the peasants owe the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corv√©es</i>, payments by labor. A
large part of every seigneury is "domain land"&mdash;for
the lord's own personal use. The peasants are obliged
to give a certain number of days to keep this plowed
and tilled, mow the meadows, bring in the hay, dress the
vines. They must also see that the castle has its firewood
and fodder; clean out the moat; help keep the
fortifications in repair; and assist on many extraordinary
occasions.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> For this they get no pay, although
they may be given their rations during the days of labor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>In time of war they do almost everything from helping
to defend the castle to marching on offensive campaigns
as part of the ban&mdash;serving, as we have seen, as grooms,
baggage attendants, diggers, and engineers, and also
as the despised, but sometimes useful, infantry pikemen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oppressive Seigneurial Officers</div>

<p>Such are the burdens of the St. Aliquis peasants.
They burn holy candles of thankfulness, however, that
Baron Conon does not multiply their troubles by intrusting
the collection of his imposts and the administration
of his forced labor to outrageous officers. Sire Macaire,
the provost, is harsh toward real offenders and strict in
exacting the last <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sol</i> or sheaf in just debts, but he is no
blackmailer, as is Foretvert's general factotum. In old
Baron Garnier's day, of course, there had been a provost
who not merely levied abominable imposts, diverting a
share thereof toward his own pocket, but who would
accuse poor men falsely of theft and then take bribes
for condoning their alleged offenses, all the time that
he was dividing the profits of real bandits whom he
protected.</p>

<p>Even more obnoxious can be the forester who controls
the hunting preserves and grazing grounds. He decides
how the peasants' pigs may be turned out in the oak
forests, how and when firewood may be cut, and he
battles incessantly with the multitudinous poachers.
A few years ago even Conon was deceived by a fellow
in his employ, one Ma√Ætre Crispin. He was "a very
handsome man with fine carriage and well armed with
bow and sword." No one could <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cong√©</i> more gracefully
to Madame Adela, or do more to help messire to discover
a great boar, but all the while he was filling his own
chest. For example, he seized lame Georges' oxen on
the pretext that he had cut three oaks and a birch in
the seigneur's forest&mdash;yet he would forget the crime if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Georges could find him one hundred sous! Fortunately
Sire Macaire discovered the evil ways of his lieutenant,
and Conon, exceedingly incensed, had the smooth
Crispin turned over to Ma√Ætre Denis and his halter
after abrupt formalities. The present forester, taught
by example, is more honest, although of course, all the
real poachers curse him.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>A great part of the peasant's time is spent neither in
working nor in resting, but in walking. Few are so
lucky as to have all their land in a single compact plot.
Even a rather poor peasant has his farm scattered in
several tiny holdings, possibly at the four quarters of
the neighborhood. When a peasant dies, his children
all divide the paternal estate, and if a separate piece of
ground cannot be provided for each heir, some lots
must be subdivided smaller still. The St. Aliquis lands
thus present a curious sight&mdash;innumerable little parcels
scattered everywhere, each carefully fenced off and
each growing its own separate crops. Meantime their
owners begin in the morning toiling with their heavy
mattocks, on one of their holdings, then on to the next,
and so on until sundown. Thus they trudge several
miles, and yet are seldom far from their village, whither
they must all return at dusk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Primitive Agricultural Methods</div>

<p>Men of more fortunate days will be astonished when
they survey the agricultural methods of even the least
stupid peasants. Everything is according to traditions&mdash;"so
it was with our fathers." In the abbey library
there are some Latin books about agriculture. They deal
with conditions in ancient Italy, however, not feudal
France. The most benevolent monk hardly dreamed of
examining his Cato or Columella to learn how to better
the lot of the peasantry, though in fairness it should
be said that the abbey farms enjoy on the whole a
much superior cultivation. Not all peasants can own
plows; they borrow or hire from their neighbors, or
break the ground with the clumsy mattocks. What
plows exist have only wooden plowshares. The wheat
in St. Aliquis is beaten out by flails, although a little
farther south it is trodden out by cattle. The soil is
often impoverished, and it is usual to leave one-third
fallow all the time to recuperate. Such a thing as
"rotation of crops" is still a matter of vague talk save
on some of the monastery lands.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, even in the best of years,
there is not much surplus of food. A short crop means
misery. Men pessimistically expect a famine on the
average of one in every four years. If there has not
been one of late in St. Aliquis, it is because the saints
are rich in mercy. "In 1197 a countless throng died of
hunger," significantly wrote a chronicler in Rheims.
Naturally, the villeins seldom get enough ahead to be
able to learn the practices of thrift. If the year has
been good, with an extra supply of corn in the barns,
and plenty of pigs and chickens fattening, the winter
will be spent in gorging and idleness. By spring the old
crop is exhausted almost to the seed corn; then perhaps
the new crop will be a failure. The next winter these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
same peasants may be glad to make a pottage of dead
leaves.</p>

<p>Lame Georges, who had his oxen sequestered, is,
despite his misfortunes, one of the most prosperous
peasants in the village. He limps because in his youth
a retainer of Baron Garnier's twisted one of his feet
while trying to extort money. Georges is really only
forty-five years old, but to see his gray head, gnarled
face, and bent back you would think him sixty. His
wife Jeanne is four years younger than he, but looks
as aged as her husband. "Old Jeanne," the children
call her. The pair have been blessed with at least fifteen
children, but four of these died in childbirth, and five
more before they could grow up. The other six are,
all but the youngest, married already and Jeanne has
been a grandmother for several years.</p>

<p>Georges' house stands near the center of the village.
To reach it you pick your way down a lane usually
deep in mud. In front of each fenced-in cottage there
is an enormous dungheap, beloved by the hens and pigs,
which roam about freely. Georges' one-story dwelling
is an irregularly built, rambling structure of wood,
wattles, and thatch, all of dirty brown. This "manse"
stretches away in four parts. The rearmost contains
the corn cribs, the next mows for hay and straw, then
the cattle sheds; and nearest, and smallest, the house
for the family.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Peasant's House</div>

<p>Pushing back the heavy door, after lifting the wooden
latch, one enters a single large room; the timbers and
walls thereof are completely blackened by soot. There
is really only one apartment. Here everything in the
household life seems to go on. The floor is of earth
pounded hard. Upon it are playing several very dirty,
half-naked children, come over to visit "grandmother,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
and just now they are chasing two squealing little pigs
under the great oak table near the center. One makes
no account of a duck leading her goslings in at the door
in hopes of scraps from the dinner. A hen is setting on
eggs in a box near the great fireplace.</p>

<p>Jeanne has just kindled a lively fire of vine branches
and dry billets. She is proud that her house contains
many convenient articles not found with all the neighbors.
By the fireplace is an iron pot hanger, a shovel,
large fire tongs, a copper kettle, and a meat hook. Next
to the fireplace is an oven, in case she does not wish to
use that at the castle and yet will pay the baron's fee.
On the other side of the fireplace is an enormous bed,
piled with a real mountain of feather mattresses&mdash;we
do not discuss their immunity from vermin. In this one
bed a goodly fraction of Georges' entire family, male
and female, old and young, have been able to sleep;
of course, with their heads usually pointing in opposite
directions. If a stranger chances to spend the night, it
will be hospitable to ask him to make "one more" in
that selfsame bed!</p>

<p>If the goodman takes us about his establishment we
shall find that, in addition to various stools and benches,
he owns a ladder, a mortar and pestle for braying corn,
a mallet, some crudely shaped nails, a gimlet, a very
imperfect saw, fishing lines, hooks, and a basket. He
is fortunate enough also to own a plow, and, in addition,
a scythe, an iron spade, a mattock, a pair of large shears,
a handy knife, and a sharpening stone. He has replaced
the stolen oxen with another pair and owns a two-wheeled
wagon with a harness of thongs and ropes.
Besides the oxen, there are three milch cows in his barn,
and he has a hennery and pigpen. The place seems also
to abound with long, lean cats, very wild, who gain a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
living by hunting the numerous rats and mice which
lurk in the dense thatch of the roofs.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_289"></a>

</div>
</div>

<p>Georges himself wears a blouse of dirt-colored cloth,
or sometimes of sheepskin, fastened by a leathern belt.
In cold weather he has a mantle of thick woolen homespun,
now also dirt color, to his knees. He has a pair
of very heavy leathern boots,
although not seldom he goes on
short walks barefoot. The lower
part of his body is covered by a
pair of loose woolen trousers
which once were blue. Very seldom,
save in storms, does he wear
any headdress; then he produces
a kind of cap of the
same dirty woolen as
his coat. As for gloves,
he never wears them
except when hedging.
Jeanne's costume is
much the same, with
a few changes to make
it suitable for women.
In her chest she has,
however, a green bliaut of Flanders wool made somewhat
in imitation of those she has seen at the castle, and it
even is beautified with red and purple embroidery. This
bliaut she wears with pride on great festival days, and
in it, despite the envious hopes of her daughters and
daughters-in-law, she expects at last to be buried.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Very Poor Peasants</div>

<p>Georges' house is considerably better than many
others. Some of his neighbors live in mere cabins that
are barely weather tight. They are made of crossed
laths stuffed with straw or grass, and have no chimney.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
The smoke from the hearth escapes through a small
hole in the roof (where the thatch is very liable to take
fire) or merely through the door.
None of these houses has glass
windows. Georges fastens his
few openings with wooden shutters,
but poor Alard near by
has to close his apertures by
stuffing them up with straw,
if it is too cold to leave them
open. Alard, too, is without
a bed. His family sleep on thin
pallets of straw laid on the
ground, with a few ragged
blankets. There are plenty of peasants who have not
even the straw.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a id="i_290"></a>

</div>
</div>

<p>Alard inevitably has no
cows, no oxen or cart, no
plow, and only a few rude
tools. He and his are barely
able to satisfy the provost's
men by grinding field labor,
and have still enough grain
laid up to carry them till the
next harvest. If it is a little
too dry, a little too wet, if,
in short, any one of a number
of untoward things happen,
by next spring he, with
his bent and bony wife and
his five lean children, will all
be standing at the castle or
abbey gate with so many other mendicants to cry their
"Bread! For the love of Christ, a little bread!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span></p>

<p>The peasants marry as early as do the nobility. Of
the moral condition of many of them it is best to say
little. Good Father √âtienne, the parish priest, spends
much of his time first in baptizing infants of unacknowledged
paternity, and then in running down their presumptive
fathers and forcing the latter to provide for
their children's upkeep. But a girl can often indulge in
amazing indiscretions and later find some self-respecting
peasant willing to marry her.</p>

<p>Every girl looks forward to her marriage as the climax
of life. If she hopes to find a husband in the coming year,
she will dance around a bonfire, then cast some pins into
a bubbling fountain. If these are
thrown to the surface it is a sign
the right swain will come along.
When drawing water from a well,
if she can throw into it an egg
cracked upon the head of some
companion, she can see in the
water the image of her future
husband. As for the young men,
when one of them decides he
wishes to marry a certain girl,
he often comes to her parents,
presenting a leathern bottle of wine. If they drink of
the same his suit is accepted. However, if he is uncertain
of his reception by the maiden herself, he invites himself
to dinner at her home. If at the end she serves him with
a dish of walnuts, it is a clear token that he is rejected.
He had better slink away.</p>

<p>On the wedding day, if the bride has always been
sage and modest, the neighbors present her with a white
hen, but her mother gives her a piece of fine cloth, to
make a gala dress which will serve ultimately for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
shroud. At the ceremony itself the great question is,
"How will the wedding ring slip on?" If easily the bride
will be docile. If it goes on tightly she will rule her
husband!</p>

<p>The peasants need every kind of public and private
holiday. On ordinary days toil begins at gray dawn
and usually continues until dusk. There are no eight-hour
laws; even the "nooning" is short, although sometimes
there is time taken out in hot weather for a siesta
during the afternoon. The women labor in the fields as
hard as do the men. Children begin weeding, digging,
and carrying when very little. Their help is so important
that many peasants look on large families as assets of so
much unpaid field labor, rather than as liabilities which
they must clothe and feed until the children reach maturity.
Education is almost unknown. One or two very
bright boys from the village somehow have been caught
by the churchmen and trained for the priesthood. There
is even a story of a lad born in a neighboring seigneury
who thus rose to be a bishop! But such cases are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
exceptional. In the whole village by St. Aliquis, Father
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Etienne'">√âtienne</ins> is the only person who understands the mysteries
of reading and writing, except two assistants of the
provost, who have to keep accounts for the baron.</p>

<p>It is very hard for great folk to understand such
teachings of the Church as that "all men are brethren."
"Doubtless it is true," Adela and Alienor have often
told each other, that "God created man in His own
image," but how is it possible that God should have the
image of most of the villeins on the seigneury? Are not
so many of them like the peasant described in the epic
"Garin"? "He had enormous hands and massive limbs.
His eyes were separated from each other by a hand's
breadth. His shoulders were large, his chest deep, his
hair bristling, and his face black as a coal. He went six
months without bathing. Nothing but rain water had
ever touched his face."</p>

<p>The manners of these people are equally repulsive.
Countless ballads as well as monks' sermons and treatises
represent your typical villein as incessantly discontented,
scolding about the weather, which is always too wet or
too dry, treating his wife like an animal, hauling her
about by the hair. Lately at the castle a jongleur told
this anecdote: "A certain peasant showered his wife
with blows on principle. 'She must have some occupation,'
said he, 'while I work in the field. If she is idle
she will think of evil things. If I beat her she will weep
the whole day through, and so will pass the time. Then
when I return in the evening she will be more tender.'"
According to other stories, however, many peasants are
clever, aggressive, and insolent&mdash;well able to care for
themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Filthy Habits of Peasants</div>

<p>The castle folk and the burghers are none too careful in
sanitary matters, but even to them the peasants are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
disgustingly filthy. They relate in Pontdebois this
story: "Once a villein, leading some donkeys, went down
the lane of the perfumer's shops. Instantly he fainted
at the unaccustomed odor. They brought him to,
however, by holding a shovel full of manure under his
nose." Another story (told at the monastery) has it
that the devil has refused to receive more villeins into
hell because they smell so vilely!</p>

<p>In the village you soon find many typical peasant
characters, and nearly all of them are bad. There is the
surly fellow who will not even tell a traveler the way.
There is the malcontent villein who mutters enviously
whenever he sees a knight riding out hawking; there is
the mad fool who reviles God, saints, Church, and nobility;
there is the talkative villein who is always
arguing bad causes before the provost's court and inciting
his neighbors to senseless litigation, there is the
honest simpleton who wandered up to Pontdebois and
got his pockets picked while gaping at the sculptures on
the portal of the cathedral; finally, there are the misers,
the petty speculators in grain (who pray for a famine),
and all the tribe of poachers. Certainly there are also
a great number of hard-working, honest folk who bow
respectfully when Messire Conon rides by and who pay
their taxes without grumbling. Such give prosperity to
the seigneury; but it is the rascals who ever thrust
themselves into prominence.</p>

<p>The St. Aliquis villeins seem doltish and dirty enough,
but they are nothing to those existing in Flanders.
Some monks have recently returned thence after doing
business for their order. They tell with horror that in
summertime Flemish peasants are seen around their
villages, taking their ease, with no more clothes on than
when they were born. When the monks remonstrated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
the rough answer was: "How is this your business?
You make no laws for us." It is pitiful (say the monks)
that any seigneur should tolerate such things on his
fief, for the peasants are such sodden creatures they
cannot of themselves be expected to know better.</p>

<p>If the knights exploit the peasants, the clergy do so
hardly less. It is notoriously hard for the bishop's tithe
collector to secure the quota of pigs, hens, eggs, wheat,
vegetables, etc., which everybody knows that the villein
owes to the Church after or upon the same time he satisfies
the collectors for the baron. Indeed, certain impious
villeins complain, "The tithe is worse than the
imposts and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corv√©es</i>." The monkish preachers have
to be constantly threatening these sinners who pay their
tithes slowly. The Church tithe is the property of God.
"It is the tax you owe to God, a sign of his universal
dominion." Those who withhold it not merely imperil
their souls, but God will send them "drought and
famine," punishing them alike in this world and the next.</p>

<p>Villeins too often wickedly insist on working on
Sundays and holy days. The peasants complain there
are so many saints' days that it is hard to keep track of
them, but if only they would go to Church on Sundays
when the priest announces the next holy days they
could avoid this sin. Worse still are the peasants who,
when they see their fellows going dutifully to mass, hide
under the hedges, then slip away to rob the unguarded
orchards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gross Oppression by Knights</div>

<p>It seems certain, therefore, that God has no such love
for villeins as he has for gentle knights and their dames.
The knights display their superiority by always reminding
their peasants of their condition. With some barons,
to flog their villein for most trifling offenses is about as
common as for them to eat their dinners. Even Conon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
has plenty of use for his riding whip. Unless the blows
are very brutal the average peasant takes this as all in
the day's work. He merely trades out his own blows
upon his wife and children. Indeed, it is commonly
said that most villeins are so numb mentally they never
can comprehend the simplest orders unless they are
driven home with stripes. In time of war the fate of
the peasants is, as we have seen, far worse than this.
Whatever a feud means to the contending parties, to
their villeins it means houses and crops burned, fruit trees
girdled, young girls dragged off to a life of infamy,
and probably the massacre of many peasants in cold
blood. One of the reasons the nobles delight so in war
is because it is seldom that they have to endure its real
anguish and horror; but in the churches the non-nobles
pray, "<em>Grant us to peace</em>" quite as fervently as they
beseech, "Save us from famine"&mdash;and with equal justice.</p>

<p>The monkish preachers who make a business of scolding
sometimes denounce high-born oppressors of the
villeins. One monk thus cries out, "All that the peasant
amasses in one year of stubborn toil, the noble devours
in an hour. Not content with his lawful revenues, he
despoils them by illicit exactions. As wolves devour
carrion while the crows croak overhead, awaiting their
share of the feast, so when knights pillage their subjects
the provosts (their agents) and others of the hellish crew
rejoice at the prospect of devouring the remainder."
Or again: "Ye nobles are ravening wolves; therefore
shall ye howl in hell," for you "despoil your subjects
and live on the blood and sweat of the poor."
(Jacques of Vitry.) Nevertheless, the selfsame preachers
accuse the peasants of the cardinal sins of avarice and of
shunning labor. Only rarely are the villeins comforted
by being told that if they work faithfully and bring up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
a proper family they are morally on equality "with a
cleric who chants all day in a church."</p>

<p>On the St. Aliquis fiefs, and, indeed, on many others,
these grosser abuses do not obtain, but nowhere are
the villeins exempt from one evil which they must
meet with dumb resignation&mdash;the seigneurial hunts.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
Conon and his guests never hesitate at going with
horses and hawks or hounds straight across plowed and
seeded fields or even over standing grain. This is the
lord's absolute right, and protest is impossible. The
hunters, too, are entitled, if far from home, to stop at the
peasants' huts and demand food and fodder, perhaps
for a large party. If payment is made, it is merely out
of charity. Greater evils still may come from the depredations
of the wild game, if the fields are close to the
hunting preserves. Villeins cannot harm any deer
nibbling the young sprouts. They can only scare them
away&mdash;and the cunning creatures soon grow daring. A
wild boar can root up a dozen little farm plots before
the baron can find leisure to chase him down. Upon
some fiefs the peasants can arrange to pay an extra fee
to their lord, in return for which he keeps only rabbits
near their fields; but the hunt of a single rabbit, if the flying
wretch doubles in among the corn, may ruin a family.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the penalties for poaching, for
"killing messire's game," are terrible. It is probably
safer on St. Aliquis'&mdash;as on any other fief&mdash;to risk
killing a traveler than killing a fawn or even a hare.
The law is pitilessly enforced by the foresters. Ma√Ætre
Denis will tell you he has hanged more stout fellows for
poaching than for any other two crimes put together.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Futile Peasant Revolts</div>

<p>Do the villeins ever revolt? Sometimes, when they
are driven to desperation by extreme misery; when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
find a clever leader; when circumstances are peculiarly
favorable. Then may come the sudden burning of
manor houses and small fortalices; the massacre of their
inmates; and other brutish deeds of tardy retaliation.
The rebels are likely to boast, as did some insurgent
peasants in Normandy in the eleventh century: "We
have been weak and insane to bend our necks for so
long. For we are strong-handed men, and solider and
stouter limbed than the nobles will ever be. For everyone
of them there are a hundred of us!"</p>

<p>Such revolts always have a single end. The ignorant
peasants submit to no discipline. They cannot use the
knight's weapons if they capture them. They cannot
organize. If they seize a castle, the liquor in the cellars
lays them out helpless through a week of orgy. The
seigneurs instantly rally and with their great horses
hunt down the rebels as creatures worse than wolves.
The vengeance then taken on the insurgents is such that
every ear that hears thereof must tingle. Perhaps along
a league of roadway a corpse will be swinging from every
tree. Such measures effectively discourage rebellion
save under most exceptional circumstances. Even with
atrocious seigneurs it is usually best to bow to the will of
God and merely to pray for deliverance.</p>

<p>Georges' and Alard's mental horizons can be imagined.
They have on rare occasions been as far as Pontdebois,
although some of their neighbors have passed a lifetime
without even that privilege. They have only the
most limited, one might say only the most animal,
hopes and fears. Their ideas of such things as the king's
court, Paris, and the various Christian and Infidel
lands are a jumble of absurd notions. "Religion"
means a few prayers, a few saints' stories, as told in the
church, the miracle plays at Christmas, and a fear lest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
by failing in proper respect to monks and priests they will
be eternally tormented in worse torture chambers than
old Baron Garnier's.</p>

<p>The villeins, of course, have their own rustic holidays,
full of rough sports&mdash;wrestling, throwing weights,
archery, and also cockfighting and bull baiting. The
best of entertainment is when two blindfolded men, each
carrying a cudgel, try to kill a goose or pig let loose in
an inclosure. The whole village roars to see them
belabor each other. During the wedding festivities, to
show their dutiful esteem for Alienor and Olivier, the
peasants had arranged a special ceremony in their honor.
Four blindfolded men were led about the neighborhood,
preceded by two men, one playing an oboe, the other
carrying a red banner whereon a pig was painted. After
this noisy merrymaking a real pig was produced, and
before an august company of most of the castle folk the
four champions "attacked the pig." They hit one
another so hard, that one was picked up almost dead.
The pig became the property of the villein who had
managed to pound the life out of the creature just as in
mercy Alienor was about to beg that the contest end.</p>

<p class="mb2">Despite grievances and grumblings, the average
peasants are loyal, somewhat after the manner of dumb
dogs, to their seigneurs. Conon and Adela command the
real affection of their villeins because of acts of charity,
but even Baron Garnier had been treated with an
astonishing faithfulness. Many a knight has owed his
life or honor to humble dependents whom he has not
treated so well as his horses or hounds. It is the toiling
thousands in the little thatched huts that make possible
the wedding feasts, the adubbements, the tourneys, and
the spectacular battles. Some day the exploitation will
cease&mdash;but not in the thirteenth century.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVII: Charity. Care of the Sick.
Funerals.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_300.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">E</span>ven upon a well-ordered seigneury the
number of the poor, disabled, and generally
miserable is great. Despite the contempt
displayed by the great for the
lowly, the Feudal Age is not lacking
in pretty abundant charity or rather in
almsgiving. The haughtiest cavalier feels it his duty
to scatter copper obols when he goes among the poor,
though doubtless he tells his squire to fling the coins
merely to "satisfy this hungry rabble." Among the
virtues of Conon and Adela is the fact that they throw
the money with their own gentle hands. This somehow
adds to the donative's value.</p>

<p>The present season is prosperous at St. Aliquis.
Furthermore, there has just been such an open house at
the castle that one would expect even the most luckless
to be satiated for a while. Nevertheless, the very day
after the guests have departed Adela is informed that
there are more than thirty people before the drawbridge,
chanting their "Alms! For the sake of Christ, alms!"
The baroness, suppressing a sigh, quits her maids, to
whom she is just assigning their weaving, and goes to
the bailey. With her attends lay-brother Gensenius, an
assistant to Father Gr√©goire, who acts as castle almoner.
The crowd contains many familiar faces. Yonder old
man on one leg, the blind woman led by a little girl, the
lad with a withered arm, the woman disfigured by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
goiter, the widow whose husband was slain in a brawl,
leaving her with eight children, the harmless idiot&mdash;all
these Adela immediately recognizes. But the excitement
of the f√™tes has attracted others whom she and Brother
Gensenius scan closely. This melancholy fellow on
crutches possibly can run very fast if he sees that the
provost's men are after him. His companion, who seems
covered with sores and who claims to be on a pilgrimage
to a healing shrine, is clearly a scamp and malingerer.
Right before the baroness a strange woman falls down
foaming at the mouth, as if she had epilepsy. Gensenius
shakes his crafty head. "She is the same impostor,"
he whispers, "who tried her trick with a bit of soap
yesterday in the village."</p>

<p>So the sheep gradually are separated from the goats.
Some of the charlatans are chased away. Some of those
who receive loaves of bread and broken meat are perhaps
no more deserving than the rejected. But dare one
really be too critical? After all, the reason why great
folk give to beggars is to cancel sins. If the beggars are
undeserving, that hardly diminishes the credit with the
saints for Conon and Adela. It would be calamitous if
there were suddenly to be no poor, worthy or unworthy,
for how then, by parting with some of their abundance,
could the rich buy peace for their souls? Fortunately,
however, there is no such danger. Our Lord has directly
said, "The poor ye have always with you," a most
comforting word of Scripture. Poverty, then, is a
blessed institution even for the fortunate in this world;
it enables them to procure entrance to heaven by acts of
charity. As for persons who are needy, of course, if
they bear their lot with Christian resignation they
accumulate a blessed stock of indulgence which will cut
short their durance in purgatory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical Severity of Mediaeval Life</div>

<p>The morning dole is a regular feature at St. Aliquis,
as at every other castle and monastery. The amount of
food given away is really very great. But there is next
to no attempt on the part of the average seigneury
really to remedy this mendicancy&mdash;to devise honest work
within the capacities of the blind or the lame; to give
systematic relief to the widow; to put the idiot lad in
some decent institution. Every premium is placed upon
the idlers, the impostors, and the low-browed rogues
who prefer anything to honest toil. In the times of real
famine, even, the temptation to cease prematurely
struggling against hard times and to lapse into beggardom
is very dangerous. Despite, therefore, much genuine
kindness on the part of many donors, charity in the
Feudal Age is allowed more than ordinarily to cover a
multitude of sins&mdash;alike those of the givers and the
receivers. Upon the St. Aliquis barony there is an astonishing
number of unabashed drones and parasites.</p>

<p class="mt2">These miserable folk, however, have some excuse.
Conditions of life in the Feudal Age, even for the cavaliers,
are very severe. Men and women begin the duties
of life young, mature young, grow old young. Henry
II of Anjou and England was only forty-seven when they
began to call him "old." Philip Augustus was only
fifteen when he was capable of assuming the actual duties
of a responsible monarch. Many a baron is gray headed
at forty. When he is fifty his sons may often be intriguing
to supplant their superannuated father. If this is true
of the nobility, what of the toiling peasantry? We have
seen how Georges and Jeanne are aged before their time.</p>

<p>Grinding toil by weakening the body, of course, leaves
it exposed to many ordinary diseases. But certainly conditions
in castle and village open the doors to extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
plagues as well. The age is happily ignorant of
sanitary precautions which more sophisticated mortals
will consider a matter of course. The peasants "almost
live on the manure heap." The clergy (though not
themselves so uncleanly) seldom preach the virtues of
bathing; indeed, their discourses on "despising the
body" apparently discourage the practice. It is hard to
keep meat any length of time unless it is salted, and the
vast amounts of salt meat consumed
everywhere are direct promoters
of scurvy and gangrene.
We have seen that nearly all the
clothing worn close to the body is
woolen. This retains filth, is hard
to wash, and irritates the skin,
another cause for frequent dermal
diseases&mdash;scrofula, the itch, and
things even worse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fearful Plagues and Mortality</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 288px;"><a id="i_303"></a>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A LEPER</p>
<p class="center">Holding in his hand the
bones with which these unfortunates
were compelled
to signal their approach
from a distance. From a
window in the cathedral of
Bourges (thirteenth century).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Leprosy is a terrible scourge.
Its nature is misunderstood. Often
severe but curable cases of eczema
are confounded therewith, and
harmless victims are condemned
to a death in life&mdash;perpetual banishment
to filthy cabins in the
woods. Cholera and smallpox every
now and then break out in a neighborhood,
and they are almost always
fatal. Nothing really can be done
to check them except to pray to
the saints. Such diseases are (say the best informed)
communicated "in the air"; consequently any ordinary
isolation is useless. On the whole, they ravage the villages
more than they do the castles, though hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
because the castle folk are able to take more effective
physic. Yet often enough a baron and his entire family
may be swept away. Very seldom is it suggested that
pure water, cleanliness, and rational schemes of isolation
can accomplish much to defeat the apparent desire of
heaven to devastate an entire duchy.</p>

<p>Other diseases are fearfully common. The sufferers
from nervous complaints make up small armies. The
general terrors and wars of the times, the brooding fears
of the devil, hell, and the eternal torment, the spectacle
of the fearful punishments, and, on the other hand, the
sheer ennui of life in many castles and in certain ill-ruled
convents, drive men and women out of their wits.
Such sufferers are lucky if they are treated with kindness
and are not, as being "possessed of devils," clapped
in a dungeon.</p>

<p>Finally, it should be said that lucky is the mother
who does not have one-third to one-half of all her offspring
die in the act of birth. Every entrance of a babe
into the world is a dice throwing with death, even if
the mid-wife is clever. Once born, the children are likely
to be so injured in the initiatory process that they will be
physically imperfect or dangerously weakened. This
is true even in the royal families; how much more true
in the peasant huts! It is not surprising that the average
man of the Feudal Ages can give and sustain hard blows.
Only the strongest have been able to survive the ordeals
of birth and childhood.</p>

<p>To fight these dangers, one must invoke both human
and divine aid. Good Christians usually feel that the
healing saints avail more than do physicians or wise
women. If you have indigestion, invoke St. Christopher;
if dropsy, St. Eutropius; if fever, St. Petronila;
for the pest, St. Roch; for insanity, St. Mathurin; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
kidney complaint, St. Ren√©; for cramps, St. Crampan&mdash;and
so with many other ills. Nevertheless, one need not
trust solely to prayers. Only great people, however,
employ regular physicians (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mires</i>). Villeins commonly
have in a "good woman," much better than a sorcerer.
The breath of an ass drives poison from a body. The
touch of a dead man's tooth cures toothache. If you
have a nosebleed, seize the nose with two straws shaped
like a cross. If the itch troubles you, roll yourself naked
in a field of oats. Georges, the peasant, will tell you
that such remedies seldom fail.</p>

<p>A local professor of the healing art is Ma√Ætre Denis, the
executioner. Since he knows so well how to mutilate
bodies, he ought to be able to understand the converse
process of curing them. He has wide reputation as a
healer of broken bones, and he often sells his patients a
panacea for multifarious ills&mdash;"the fat of a man just
hung."</p>

<p>There is at least this to be said for the peasants: the
science of <em>their</em> healers will agree almost as much with
that of later physicians as does that of the contemporary
"physicians" themselves. The Church has not given any
too great encouragement to medicine. The mighty St.
Ambrose has said that the proper healing is by prayers
and vigils. Only clerics of the inferior orders are allowed
to study medical science, and the dissection of dead
bodies is decidedly discountenanced.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>At the castle the ordinary functionary to abate bodily
ills is Ma√Ætre Louis, the baron's barber. When not
scraping chins, he was very likely giving the castle folk
their monthly bleedings, without which it is very hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>to keep one's health. The bleedings take place, if
possible, in the great hall near the fire, and are undergone
regularly by both sexes. When the St. Aliquis forces are
called to war, Ma√Ætre Louis goes with them as barber-surgeon,
and he really has considerable skill in setting
fractures and cauterizing and salving wounds, as well as
with a few powerful drugs&mdash;mostly purgatives&mdash;which
probably help those of his patients who have the strongest
constitutions to recover.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Professional Physicians</div>

<p>When one of the baron's own family is seriously sick,
it is usual to send to Pontdebois for a professional physician.
About two years ago Conon
himself fell into a fever. They
brought to him Ma√Ætre Payen, who
claimed to have learned his art as
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mire</i> by travel among the schools of
medicine&mdash;at Salerno in Sicily, at
Montpellier in the Languedoc country,
and even at Cordova among the Infidels,
although the baron swore angrily
(after he was gone) that he had never
been nearer any of these places than
Paris.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 243px;"><a id="i_306"></a>
  <img src="images/i_306.jpg" width="243" height="600" alt="A THIRTEENTH-CENTURY DOCTOR" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A THIRTEENTH-CENTURY DOCTOR</p>
<p class="center">Restored by Viollet-Le-Duc, from a manuscript
in the Biblioth√®que nationale.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ma√Ætre Payen was sprucely dressed
half as a priest, half as a rich burgher.
He wore elegant furs. He talked very
learnedly of "febrifuges" and "humors,"
and kept repeating, "Thus says
Avincenna, the prince of Spanish physicians,"
or, "Thus says Albucasis, the
infallible follower of Avincenna." If
Conon had suffered from some easily discoverable malady,
probably Ma√Ætre Payen could have suggested a fairly
efficient means of cure. He was not without shrewdness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
and in his chest was a whole arsenal of herbs and drugs.
He had also efficient salves, although he had never
heard the word "antiseptic." But the baron had
picked up one of those maladies which baffled easy
diagnosis. Ma√Ætre Payen, therefore, fussed about, clearly
betraying his bewilderment, then struck a professional
attitude and announced oracularly, "The obstruction to
health is in the liver."</p>

<p>"Nay," groaned the baron, "it is in the head that I
feel so wretched."</p>

<p>"That is foolish," retorted the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mire</i>, crushingly:
"Beware of that word 'obstruction,' because you do
not understand what it signifies."<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>He next muttered certain cabalistic words; said that
the baron should be glad that his liver was affected,
because that was the seat of honor, and that upon
recovery his honor would be enlarged. The spleen was
the seat of laughter, while the lungs fanned the heart.
Payen then talked of remedies. Perhaps the urine of a
dog would be best, or the blood of a hegoat; but these
were only villein remedies. Messire, the patient, was a
great noble and needed noble remedies, suitable for
his rank. He would therefore (since the liver was affected)
give him the dried and pulverized liver of a toad. And
so he left his medicines, took a gold piece, and departed.</p>

<p>That night Conon was delirious, but Adela, who, like
every mistress of a castle, had perforce learned much of
nursing, applied cold cloths to his body, while Father
Gr√©goire prayed to the saints. The next morning,
because of the cloths, the saints, or toad's liver, the fever
abated. Perhaps it had merely run its natural course.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>After the baron recovered he would curse terribly at
mention of Ma√Ætre Payen. He would be ready enough to
cry "amen!" to the saying of the monk Guy of Provins,
"they (the physicians) kill numbers of the sick, and
exhaust themselves to find maladies for everybody.
Woe to him who falls into their power! I prefer a capon
to all their mixtures!" The monk concedes, indeed,
that certain physicians are useful, but that it is because
of the confidence which they inspire rather than thanks
to their medicines that they effect cures.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Healing Relics and Processions</div>

<p>When next Conon falls sick, he vows that he will
trust simply to Ma√Ætre Louis or even to Ma√Ætre Denis,
although he may consent to send for a Lazarist monk,
a member of the great monastic order which makes a
specialty of healing the sick. For although these truly
noble monks (who combine worldly wisdom with an
equal amount of piety) treat especially leprosy, they
are gradually turning their attention to diseases in
general. If he cannot get a Lazarist, he will be likely to
hire in an astrologer to discover a remedy by consulting
the stars; or Father Gr√©goire may organize a "healing
procession" of all the monks, clerks, and pious laymen
whom he can muster. With solemnity they will carry
the whole stock of saints' relics in the neighborhood to
the sick seigneur, and lay them devoutly upon his
abdomen. This remedy was tried in Paris some time
ago to cure Prince Louis, the king's heir, and he recovered
promptly. Similar assistance is available for a great
seigneur like Conon.</p>

<p class="mt2">Not always, indeed, will even the saints' relics avail.
When the time had come for the good Lady Odelina,
Conon's mother, they postponed extreme unction to the
final moment, because after that ceremony the sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
person has really no right to get well. The hair falls out
and the natural heat is diminished. The moment breath
quitted the noble dame's body, the servants ran furiously
through the castle, emptying every vessel of water lest
the departing soul should be drowned therein. The
dead body was also watched carefully until burial, lest
the devil should replace it in its coffin with a black cat,
and likewise lest a dog or cat should run over the coffin
and change the corpse into a vampire. Conon and
Adela are not convinced of these notions, but do not
dispute them with the servitors.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_309"></a>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A THIRTEENTH-CENTURY BURIAL SCENE</p>
<p class="center">From an English manuscript (Schultz).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Next the body was carefully embalmed. The heart
was removed, to be buried at a nunnery whereof Lady
Odelina had been the patroness. A waxen death mask
was made of the face, and the body was laid out on a
handsome bed with black hangings. A temporary altar
was set up in the apartment that masses might be said
there, and one or two of Conon's vassals or squires remained
on guard night and day, fully armed, while
round the bed blazed two or three scores of tall candles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Funeral Customs</div>

<p>The interment took place in the abbey church, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
transept where rested so many of the St. Aliquis stock.
They laid upon the Lady Odelina's breast a silver cross
engraved with the words of absolution; and in the heavy
stone casket also were buried four small earthen pots,
each of which had contained some of the incense burned
during the funeral ceremony. Finally, when the rites
were over, Conon employed a cunning sculptor to make
a life-size marble effigy of his mother, to rest upon the
slab covering her tomb&mdash;an effigy which, by the dignity
and genuine peace of form and face, was long to express
how truly noble had been his gracious mother.</p>

<p>Common folk cannot have marble caskets and effigies,
but even poor peasants are graced with decidedly elaborate
funerals. When a person of the least consequence
in the village dies, a crier goes down all the lanes, ringing
a bell and calling out the name of the deceased, adding,
"Pray God for the dead." Peasants of quality are likely
to be laid away in plaster coffins, although the poorest
class of villeins are wrapped only in rags and tossed into
shallow pits.</p>

<p class="mb2">Still worse is the fate of those who die excommunicated
by the Church or of suicides. These unfortunates cannot
even be buried in holy ground. Their bodies are
often exposed, to be torn by the dogs and crows. Sometimes,
however, a hardened sinner repents sufficiently
on his deathbed to be restored to the graces of religion.
But in this case his body is frequently burned, all laden
with iron or brazen fetters. The idea is thus to mortify
the body, even after the breath of life has departed, and
so to abate those fires in purgatory assuredly awaiting
for all save great saints, who can pass straight to heaven,
or the numerous reprobates whose guilt requires not
temporary, but eternal torment.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVIII: Popular Religion. Pilgrimages.
Superstitions. Relic Worship.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_311.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">A</span>ll the folk of St. Aliquis are Christians.
Nobody, far and wide, except a few Jews
in Pontdebois, openly dissents from the
Catholic religion, denies the validity of
the creeds, or refuses a certain outward
conformity to the Church practices. The
age is not greatly interested in improving the general
moral and social condition of the common people. The
common people even are not always interested in this
themselves. Each peasant prays for "just treatment"
and for good luck. Otherwise, castle and village alike
accept as a kind of natural law the immutability of
society. God has established the various orders and
gradations. All that one can ask is that each man shall
accept the condition assigned to him and live in it
efficiently and happily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Religious Attitude of Knights</div>

<p>Conon, like every other knight, has no temptation to
unbelief. The doctors of the Church know all about
religion, just as the king's falconers know all about
hawking. It is sensible to trust the expert. If you ask
idle questions, you merely risk your soul, as do the
followers of Mahound, the false prophet. The baron
frequently denounces the arrogance and covetousness of
the clergy and resists their pretentions, but he nevertheless
trusts them to supply him with the Sacraments and
bless his death and burial so that his soul may pass
promptly through purgatory into paradise&mdash;where existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
presumably is one grand admixture of a marriage
feast in a fine garden and of a magnificent tournament.
Plenty of knights are lax and blasphemous, but they
hardly are deliberately unbelieving.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Good knights ought
to hear mass every morning;
venerate holy objects
and places; hate
Jews and Saracens; worship
the Virgin and the
saints; also keep most of
the major fasts and other
special occasions of the
Church. Conon does all
these things. He is "a
good Christian." But
he is exempted from any
serious thinking for
himself upon mysterious
matters.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_312"></a>
  <img src="images/i_312.jpg" width="400" height="389" alt="A GROUP OF PRIESTS, THIRTEENTH CENTURY" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A GROUP OF PRIESTS, THIRTEENTH CENTURY</p>
<p class="center">The one who is near the altar is wearing

The second carries the consecrated wafer
and the third a sort of fan. (From a
manuscript in the Biblioth√®que nationale.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>When Conon prays in
the morning, if not hurried
he lies down with his head turned toward the east,
and his arms stretched out like a cross. He recites the
favors which God has shown him in the past, beseeches
Heaven to continue favorable. Often he adds a Credo and
a certain paraphrase of the Lord's Prayer then very common&mdash;"Our
Father, who desirest that we all be saved,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>grant that we acquire Thy love even as have the angels
who do thy pleasure on high; and give us our daily
bread&mdash;for the soul the Holy Sacrament, and for the
body its needful sustenance." Yet if his mood is not
unusually humble and contrite, he is likely to conclude
patronizingly, "And I confide also in the strength of my
heart, which thou hast bestowed, in my good sword
and my fleet horse, yet especially in Thee!"</p>

<p>Many a cavalier breaks into blasphemies when things
go wrong. Such men are like William Rufus of England,
who cried, "God shall never see me a good man&mdash;I
have suffered too much at His hands!" Or Henry II,
who, on learning that his son Henry had revolted, cried
aloud, "Since Thou, O God, hast taken away from me
that which I prized the most, Thou shalt not have what
Thou prizest most in me&mdash;my soul." And even Conon,
once when hard beset, had exclaimed, like a certain
crusading lord: "What king, O Lord, ever deserted thus
his men? Who <em>now</em> will trust in or fight for thee?"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, one should deal mercifully with such
sinful words, for, after all, is not the world very evil and
the temptation to rail at God extremely great? It is
true that things are not as they were in the year <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
1000, when even the wisest felt very sure the Last Day
was at hand. Eclipses, comets and famines had then
seemed foreshadowing this. People crowded the churches
in agony, expecting to hear the Seven Trumpets announce
Antichrist. Repeatedly since then, when the years
have been calamitous, monks and old wives have stirred
multitudes by vehement predictions that the plagues
of the Apocalypse and the other preliminaries to the
millennium are not to be delayed. As late as <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1200
the monk Rigord, at the abbey of St. Denis, wrote:
"The world is ill; it grows so old that it relapses into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
infancy. Common report has it that Antichrist has
been born at Babylon and that the Day of Judgement is
nigh."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Fearful Excommunication</div>

<p>Fears like this restrain even reckless seigneurs and
sodden peasants from proceeding to inconceivable
crimes. The agonies of the damned will be so dreadful!
The preachers understand very well that it is of little
use to try to restrain the wicked by talking of "the love
and mercy of God." If King Philip had only used love
and mercy upon his vassals he would be now a king
without a kingdom. It is the dread of the eternal burning
which apparently keeps a large part of all Christendom
tolerably obedient to the more essential mandates of
morality and of the Church.</p>

<p>When a great criminal deliberately defies the Church
there is a ceremony which makes even the righteous
inquire as to their own salvation. A few months ago a
certain impious baron robbed a parish church of a chalice.
Instantly at Pontdebois the bishop took action. The
great bell of the cathedral tolled as for a funeral; and
such it was, though of the soul, far more precious than
merely the body. The bishop appeared in the chancel
with all his clergy. Each cleric held a lighted candle.
The building was hung with black tapestry. Amid a
terrible hush the bishop announced the name of the
offending knight to the crowded nave, then proclaimed
in loud voice: "Let him be cursed in the city and cursed
in the field; cursed in his granery, his harvest, and his
children; as Dathan and Abiram were swallowed up by
the gaping earth, so may hell swallow him; and even as
to-day we quench these torches in our hands, so may the
light of his life be quenched for all eternity, unless he do
repent!" Whereat all the priests dashed their torches to
the pavement and trampled them out. One could almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
see that sacrilegious baron writhing in the flames of
Gehenna.</p>

<p>After a scene like this there is no reinstatement for
the sinner save by some great act of penance and mortification.
An excommunicated person is next door to an
outlaw. He may find sundry companions in crime, but
most people will shun him as they would a leper. This
particular baron, after vain boasts and defiance, at last
was so conscience-torn and forsaken that he made an
abject peace with the bishop. First, he gave ruinously
costly gifts to the cathedral; then he presented himself
barefoot and in the robe of a pilgrim at the chancel.
He prostrated himself and for a day and a night remained
in prayer before the high altar, eating and drinking
nothing. After that he knelt again while some three-score
clerics and monks present each smote him with a
rod, he crying aloud, "Just are Thy judgments, O Lord!"
after every blow. Not till all this was accomplished
did the bishop raise him, pronounce the absolution, and
give him the kiss of peace. It was very dreadful.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>For lesser offenses against the Church there are lesser
but effective penalties. In Pontdebois there was once a
religious procession in Lent. A certain woman marched
therein with pretended devoutness, but then went home
and in defiance of the fast-time dined upon some mutton
and ham. The odor escaped into the street. The woman
was seized, and the bishop condemned her to walk
through the town with her quarter of mutton on
the spit over her shoulder, the ham slung round her
neck, and with a ribald crowd, of course, trailing
behind. After that penance the fasts were well kept in
Pontdebois.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Festive Side of Popular Religion</div>

<p>Yet one must not think of the religion of this Feudal
Age as in general sad. On the contrary (by one of those
abrupt contrasts now grown familiar) clergy and people
get vast joy, not to say amusement, even out of the
sacred ordinances. "Men go gayly along the road to
salvation." For example, the great pilgrimages (pardons)
are often festive reunions with merchants chaffering and
jongleurs playing or doing their tricks while the whole
company proceeds to some shrine.</p>

<p>Even in the church building solemnity is not always
maintained. The choir, indeed, belongs pretty strictly
to worship, but in the nave all sorts of secular proceedings
can go on, even the meetings of malcontent factions and
of rioters. The church bells ring for markets, for musters,
or for peaceful gatherings almost as often as they ring
for the holy services. As for the sacred festivals, good
bishops complain that they are so numerous that the
secular element intrudes utterly, and disfigures them with
idleness and carousing. The peasants may go to early
mass; after that they will drink, chatter, sing, dance
(in a very riotous fashion), and join in wrestlings, races,
and archery contests until nightfall.</p>

<p>Besides these ordinary abuses of holy things, every
parish seems to have its own special Reign of Folly,
although the name of the celebration varies from place
to place. Even the younger clergy participate in such
mock ceremonies. In Pontdebois the subdeacons elect
a Pope of Buffoons, give him a silver tiara, and enthrone
him with much dignity, electing at the same time several
"cardinals" to help direct his revels. There are noisy
processions, cavalcades, and even scandalous parodies
of some of the most sacred services of the Church. The
mock pope issues "bulls" enjoining all kinds of horseplay,
and actually strikes a kind of lead money with such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
legends as "Live merrily and rejoice," or, "Fools are
sometimes wise." It seems next to impossible to confine
such proceedings to the streets, the market place and
the church porch, although decent bishops fight against
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'instrusions'">intrusions</ins> into the holy building. The canons of the
cathedral have finally induced the junior clergy and the
lay rabble to refrain from the more extreme parodies
and from such pranks as stealing the church bells by
giving the "Pope" and all his noisy rout a grand dinner.
Pious churchmen groan on such days, but they comfort
themselves by saying that these proceedings make religion
popular and give an outlet for "the flesh," which if
restrained too much, will succumb before even worse
temptations of the devil.</p>

<p>In St. Aliquis village the parish priest actually participates
in a ceremony equally calculated to astonish another
age. On a certain Sunday the folk celebrate the
virtues of the ass which bore our Lord and the Holy
Virgin when St. Joseph fled with them into Egypt. The
peasants take the best ass in the neighborhood, caparison
it gayly, and lead it through the streets to the church, all
the children running along, waving flower wands and
shouting, with the older folk almost equally demonstrative.
At the holy portal the priest meets them and
announces in Latin "This is a day of mirth. Let all
sour lookers get themselves hence. Away with envy!
Those who celebrate the Festival of the Ass desire
jollity!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mass of the Ass</div>

<p>Then the ass is led straight up into the chancel and
tethered to the altar rail. A solemn Prose, half Latin,
half French, is chanted, setting forth the virtues of the
faithful, stolid beast which enabled our Lord to escape
the wicked Herod. Ever and anon the cantor stops and
all the crowded church rings with the refrain, "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">He! haw!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
sire ass&mdash;he! haw!</i>" everybody trying to pull down his
nose and bray as lustily as possible. Finally, when the
ass has been led decorously back to his stall, the choristers,
with many friends, indulge in a bountiful repast.
This Festival of the Ass is celebrated in very many
French cities and villages.</p>

<p>One must also comprehend that certain saints are
the particular patrons of given regions. St. Martin is
a potent saint through all France, but St. Denis is the
especial guardian of the royal domains; St. Nicholas of
Lorraine, St. Andre of Burgundy, and of course St.
George of England. St. Michael, too, may assist French
knights sooner than he will foreigners. There are also
many local saints of incalculable sacredness in their own
small regions, yet hardly heard of elsewhere. Thus, if
you travel very far, you are likely to lose all trace of
good St. Aliquis, and, indeed, peevish visitors have
suggested that he has never been canonized at Rome or
properly accepted by the Catholic Church. For all that,
he is venerated locally, perhaps with greater fervor than
any other holy one, saving always our Blessed Lady
herself.</p>

<p>There is no saint with whom it is possible to compare
the Virgin. She is the "Lady of Heaven," the "Queen of
the Holy City," the "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Dame d√©bonnaire</i>." God the
Father and God the Son seem perhaps to be inaccessible
celestial emperors, but the Holy Virgin, who understands
the needs of toiling men, will transmit their
pleas and exert her vast influence in their behalf. Therefore,
on her statues she is dressed like a feudal queen
with rich stuffs, a crown glittering with jewels, and she
bears a royal scepter and an orb of the world. All the
saints are her vassals and do her liege homage.</p>

<p>There is another set of joyous celebrations legitimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
and uplifting. At Christmas time, on <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">No√´l</i> eve the
good folk will install a heifer, an ox, and an ass in the
parish church "to warm the holy babe with their breath."
Torches are lighted everywhere and fires are lit upon
the hills. Groups of people march about dressed like
shepherds bound for the Christchild's manger and led
by pipes and viols, while all sing joyously:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Good sirs, now hark ye!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From far lands come we,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For it is No√´l."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then in the church are sung long responses, telling the
story of Christmas in the vernacular and interspersed
with comments by the animals in Latin, because (as
says the hymn)</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All the beasts in other days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke French less well than Latin.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So the cock crows out his satisfaction, the goat bleats, the
calf bellows, the ox lows, the ass brays. It is all done
simply, reverently, and for the benefit of simple, loving
souls.</p>

<p>In Pontdebois, however, they have a more elaborate
performance. Twelve clerks, representing six Jews and
six pagans, present themselves in the cathedral choir,
declaring they wish to examine the evidence that the
babe newly born is truly the Redeemer. Whereat appear
in stately sequence all the prophets who have forewarned
the coming of Christ, besides Moses with his
horn, Balaam with his ass, the three Hebrew children of
the fiery furnace, the pagan sybils, and the twelve
apostles. Each responds with canticles in sonorous
Latin, until the twelve doubters declare themselves
satisfied and fall down to worship the Infant King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mystery Plays</div>

<p>At Easter there are other mystery plays telling the
story of the divine Passion and of the Resurrection; and
still others come at intervals through the year. Some of
the participants are priests, but many others laymen,
both men and women.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> All the more important episodes
in the Bible are acted out with considerable detail
and with much comedy interspersed. The crowds howl
with glee when Ananias, like a shrewd Jew, chaffers for
the sale of his field, or when hideous devils leap up from
hell to seize Herodias's daughter the instant she has
accomplished her wicked will with John the Baptist.
There is no attempt to represent ancient times. Herod
is dressed like a feudal duke, and before him is carried a
crucifix. The numerous devils are always black; the
angels wear blue, red, and white; "God" appears wearing
a papal tiara; and the "souls of the dead" appear
covered with veils&mdash;white for the saved, red or black for
the damned. It is a source of great delight for the people
to take part in these plays, and even the great folk are
not above joining in them. One need not comment on
how completely such proceedings impress the imaginations
of the unlearned with the stories of the Old and
New Testaments. The Bible can be <em>read</em> only by the
few, but an essential part of it is <em>seen</em> and reasonably
comprehended by the many.</p>

<p class="mt2">So much for ordinary religious beliefs and occasions.
But there are plenty of people who find their sins are
so terrible that they must resort to some great penances,
often consuming the remainder of their lives, in order to
propitiate Heaven. Besides the monks and the nuns
dwelling in convents, there exist a great many hermits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
and "religious solitaries," who abide in little huts in
the woods, perhaps maintaining a tiny chapel for travelers,
and being fed on the offerings of forest rangers and
peasants. Not all these hermits live, however, in genuine
solitude. Right in St. Aliquis village there is
something everywhere common&mdash;a female recluse.</p>

<p>Many years ago, a certain peasant woman, Elise,
murdered her husband. She was promptly condemned
to the gallows, but Baron Garnier, with unusual mercy,
pardoned her on condition "that she be shut up within
a small house in the cemetery, that she might there do
penance and so end her days." A stone hut was accordingly
built, and the unhappy woman conducted thither
with a regular procession, two priests blessing the hut
and giving Elise a kind of consecration. She was put
inside. Every aperture was then built up except a
narrow chink to admit air, a little light, and a small dole
of food from her relatives.</p>

<p>Elise has been vegetating in this hut for now twenty
years&mdash;living in filth and darkness, but talking most
piously to visitors standing outside. Seemingly, she
does little except to mutter almost incessant prayers.
Already her crime is forgotten. The peasants speak of
her as "that holy woman" and even wonder whether,
after she dies in her cell&mdash;for she will never leave it&mdash;she
cannot be enrolled among the saints. There are
many other much more innocent recluses, male and
female, who have been walled up voluntarily&mdash;either out
of piety or of sheer love of idleness, possibly because of
both.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Recluses and Pilgrims</div>

<p>Nevertheless, ordinarily the best way to discharge the
load of a guilty conscience is by pilgrimage. Confessors
often impose this means of penance upon penitents, as
the best way of winning the divine mercy. Since death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
is about the only judicial penalty for great crimes, a
penance of pilgrimage for six, ten, or twelve years&mdash;going
from shrine to shrine all over Christendom&mdash;is
really a substitute for a term of imprisonment. Pilgrims
of this pronounced type are required to go barefoot, with
head shaved, to quit their families and wives, and to
fast continually&mdash;that is, never to touch meat more
than once a day.</p>

<p>Even exalted nobles thus spend the remainder of a
lifetime expiating their iniquities. Everyone has heard
of Count Fulk the Black of Anjou, who heaped up misdeeds
even to the murdering of his wife. Then at last he
realized the awful peril to his soul. Three times he
made the long pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the third time
letting himself be dragged upon a hurdle through the
streets of the Sacred City, while two varlets smote him
with whips.</p>

<p>Such great criminals often carry passports issued by
bishops, certifying that they are expiating by pilgrimage
specified evil deeds&mdash;and requesting Christian folk to
give them lodging, food, and assistance. These penitents,
if knights, are likely to wear chains upon their wrists
and neck, forged of their own armor, as witnesses at
once of their social position and their genuine repentance.</p>

<p>Most pilgrims, however, have no such fearful things
weighing down their souls. They are simply ordinary
erring men who are moved by a genuine piety, possibly
admixed with a willingness to find excuse for "seeing the
world." Every day they appear at the gate of St. Aliquis
castle to ask a share in the supper and a bed on the
rushes in the hall, and they are respectfully treated,
although Conon sometimes complains that their trailing
robes of brown wool, heavy staffs, and sacks slung
at belt are merely the disguises for so many wandering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
rogues. Unwashed and unkempt though many of them
are, it never does to repulse them, lest you lose the
Scriptural blessing for those who received strangers and
so "have entertained angels unawares."</p>

<p>Pilgrims, too, are good newsmongers. They supply
you with tidings from Italy, Germany, Spain, or even the
Holy Land. They will carry letters also to foreign
parts and transmit verbal messages to kinsmen. They
do not always travel alone, but by twos, fives, or even
tens. Recently at Dunkirk, where the peasants revolted,
the bishop laid upon twenty-five of their leaders the
penance that they should spend a year going about in a
body to different holy places and joining in religious
processions "in twenty-six churches," wearing no clothing
save their trousers, going barefoot, and carrying the
rods with which they had been disciplined.</p>

<p>Innumerable are the shrines where sinners can profit
their souls by a visit. Every important abbey claims to
be a pilgrimage resort, and the monks will tell of remarkable
miracles wrought by all the saints whose relics
they chance to treasure. Probably there are more than
a thousand such places whose claims have been somewhat
recognized by the Church. Many of these shrines
have some famous image of the Madonna, frequently
brought from the East by Crusaders, but often very old
and, to carnal thinking, ugly, perhaps only a "black
virgin," a clumsy doll carved of wood. This matters not,
provided it is holy and efficacious. "Our Lady of the
Fountain" at Samour, "Our Lady of the Osier" near
Grenoble, "Our Lady of Good Hope" at Valenciennes,
Our Lady of Chartres, of Liesse, of Rocamadour, of
Auray, of Puy&mdash;these are merely examples.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Favorite Pilgrim Shrines</div>

<p>The greater the distance the pilgrim must go, the
greater his merit ordinarily. Happy the pilgrim who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
can venerate the bones of an actual apostle, as at Rome.
Happiest of all is he who can go to Jerusalem and pray
at the Holy Sepulcher. Nevertheless, God has provided
very efficacious shrines nearer home. Right at Paris
there are the seats of St. G√©nevieve and the great St.
Denis. You can pay
your devout homage
at Tours to the puissant
St. Martin, the
ideal of pious warriors.
In Normandy,
where Mont St.
Michel looks across
the sands to the
tumbling ocean, one
can pray best to the
mighty archangel
nearest to God. It
avails much, also, to
visit St. Martial of
Limoges, St. Sernin
of Toulouse, and
more still to visit
Spain and at Compostella beseech the intercession of St.
James the Apostle.</p>

  <span class="caption">A SHRINE IN THE FORM OF AN ALTAR

</div>

<p>Assuredly, however, Rome is best (always barring
Jerusalem), and on the way thither the pilgrim can lighten
his spiritual load by visiting many excellent Italian
shrines&mdash;such as "Our Guardian Lady" at Genoa, and,
at Lucca, "Our Lady of the Rose." In the city of St.
Peter itself, time fails to enumerate the three hundred
churches worthy of a devout visit. Besides the majestic
cathedral of the Prince of the Apostles and the tomb of
St. Paul, even the most hurried pilgrim will not fail to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
repair to St. Maria Maggiore, where is the actual manger
in which Christ was born; and St. John Lateran, where
are the holy stairs Christ ascended while wearing the
crown of thorns; St. Peter in Montorio, where Peter
himself was crucified, St. Lawrence Without the Walls,
where the blessed martyrs St. Stephen and St. Lawrence
are buried; not to mention others. A man must be a
master criminal if he cannot deliver his soul by suitable
visits to these invaluable shrines in Rome.</p>

<p>As is well known, the blessed saints both in this life
and after death wrought many miracles through their
relics. These wonders continue to-day, although the
iniquities of mankind render them infrequent. Every
now and then Heaven still permits some holy man to
work undoubted miracles. Thus only recently it is
said that when the venerable abbot of St. Germer
preached the Fourth Crusade in England, he need only
bless a fountain, lo! its waters made the dumb speak,
the blind see, and the sick recover. Once (so a pilgrim
related in the castle only the other day) when this abbot
reached a village which wanted a supply of water, he
gathered all the folk in the church. Right in the presence
of the people he smote a stone with his staff and water
flowed forth&mdash;not merely potable, but healing for all
maladies.</p>

<p>God also speaks to us in dreams as he did to Pharaoh
and Nebuchadnezzar. He caused St. Thomas √† Becket
to visit the late king Louis VII and warn him to make a
pilgrimage to St. Thomas's new shrine of Canterbury to
pray for the recovery of his son Philip, later "Augustus."
Henry II of England was Louis' foe, but the king made
the solemn pilgrimage unimpeded, and the crown prince
duly recovered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Omens, Spirits and Monsters</div>

<p>Omens of calamity, too, appear often, although it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
not always clear whether sent from God or the devil. A
few years ago the wolves in the forest near the monastery
of St. Aliquis howled steadily all through the day of
the feast of St. Honore. "A clear sign of trouble,"
announced the prior; and four days later the feud began
betwixt Conon and Foretvert, which convulsed the whole
countryside. Many a man is warned to prepare for
death by seeing a will-o-the-wisp in the marshes, a
shooting star, or a vulture hovering above his house. If
thirteen people chance to sit at one table, or if one chances
to dream of a physician, it is proof positive some one in
the house is about to die. The same is true if a man inadvertently
puts on a clean white shirt on Friday;
while if the left eye of a dead man will not close promptly
the deceased will soon have company in purgatory. Any
woman, also, who thoughtlessly washes her clothes in
lye during the holy week is not long for this world. It is
needless to explain how sinister are eclipses and comets.
In July, 1198, there was a great comet visible. Sage
people wagged their heads with melancholy satisfaction
when Richard the Lion Hearted died very soon after.</p>

<p class="mt2">Time will fail to list all the strange beings, neither
human, angel, nor exactly devil, that Providence permits
to infest the world. These creatures possess no souls, and
when they perish are gone like cattle, although they live
long and are very hard to kill. Probably they are more
numerous in wild and solitary places, yet towns and
crowded castles are not free from them. Thus there are
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">f√©es</i> (fairies) good and bad&mdash;creatures relatively like
human beings; undines in the waters, who by their
perfidious beauty lure unwary knights to destruction;
ogres who lie in wait to devour small children; ghouls
who disinter the dead and gnaw their bones; vampires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
who rise every night from the tombs and suck the blood;
wolf-men (humans turned into beasts) who attack
lonely travelers; dracs, who carry off little children to
their subterranean realms; will-of-the-wisps in the
marshes, who are the souls of unbaptized dead infants;
also many rather friendly spirits such as the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soleves</i>,
who sometimes overnight do a weary laborer's work for
him. It needs much knowledge to tell the good spirits
from the bad&mdash;to know, <i>e.g.</i>, whether you are dealing
with a goblin who will only display harmless antics,
or an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">estrie</i>, a real imp of darkness, who may hug you
like a bear, to suffocation.</p>

<p>The Church does not forbid the belief in these creatures,
nor of such pagan monsters as giants, pygmies,
cyclops, satyrs, tritons, sirens, etc., although it plainly
teaches us that they are only ministers of the devil.
The existence of the devil is as certain as that of the
Holy Trinity. As has been said already, the fear of
falling into his clutches has often a more excellent effect
upon the sinner than the love of God. Countless legends
and sculptures in the cathedrals tell all about the master-fiend.
The monk in his convent, the peasant in his hut,
yes (for all his brave words and his long sword), the
baron in his castle, all tremble lest they meet him.</p>

<p>The devil produces all kinds of misery, and he can
actually take possession of the living bodies of men. It
is affirmed that once, not far from St. Aliquis, a knight
was sitting peaceably at table when suddenly the devil
entered into him. The fiend spoke through the poor
man's mouth. He raved and uttered blasphemies. The
priest brought his book of exorcisms. When he recited
them, the devil screamed horribly. Yet for some days
he resisted the holy formulas, and then departed, leaving
his victim utterly exhausted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>

<p>It is much worse when you make a direct pact with
the devil. Some time ago, it is affirmed, there was a
young scholar at Paris. He was much troubled because
he progressed slowly in his studies. Then Satan visited
him, saying: "Do me homage. I will make you excel
in wisdom!" He gave the youth a stone, asserting that,
"So long as you hold this stone in your hand you will
know everything." Soon the lad astonished the schools
by his erudition, but, on falling sick, confessed his crime,
threw away his stone, and at once forgot all his learning.
Speedily he died. At once the devils began to torture his
soul, but God promptly sent an angel ordering them "to
let alone this soul which you have tormented." Immediately
the soul flew back into the body, which sprang to
life even as the Paris students were celebrating the funeral
service. The revived scholar, however, at once entered
a convent and took no more chances with carnal studies.</p>

<p>Very many people, however, have compounded with
the devil and been less fortunate. The fiend apparently
will not come unless one is in a desperate plight and
willing to promise everything. Then usually the unhappy
mortal must deny the Christian faith, repudiate
the saints, utter blasphemies, and, it is even asserted,
kiss the arch fiend upon the buttocks. Next a horrid
oath must be taken, standing inside of three magic
circles and burning incense. After that the devil will, it
is true, give his votary great worldly prosperity and especially
riches through a long life, but in the end the
fiend never fails to claim his soul for an eternal possession.
It is even said that Satan made such a bargain with the
great ecclesiastic Gerbert, who became Pope Sylvester II.
He was very wise<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> or very wicked, probably both; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>in the opinion of many he rose to be Pope by the aid of
"a hierarchy of demons and a brass idol which uttered
oracles." But on the day of his death (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1002) Satan
demanded his own; and whenever a pope lies near his
end the bones of Sylvester II rattle in the tomb. The
Church discredits this scandalous story, but it is widely
believed.</p>

<p>Since the recent trial of a witch and a wizard before
the bishop at Pontdebois, the folk near St. Aliquis have
gained a much more precise knowledge of the black art.
Magicians usually begin their ceremonies by creating a
magic smoke of various inflammables and spices, also by
burning such fiend-compelling ingredients as the brain of
an eagle, the blood of a black cat, and plenty of hellebore.
The smoke thus created is so dense and foul that uninitiated
customers are readily convinced there are demons
rising in the vapor and talking to the wizard. Thanks to
such assistance, the magician, and his even more sinful
wife, the witch, were able to instruct how to find a pot
of gold and how to rob the house of a rich Jew, but
especially they could prepare philters&mdash;some of them
intended to inspire love and others hatred. Wives could
buy fearful compounds made of substances from "the
three domains of nature"&mdash;the entrails of animals, scales
of fishes, parings of nails, human blood, pulverized load-stone,
and such powerful drugs as mandragora&mdash;which, if
duly brewed and beaten up together, then put in an
unfaithful husband's goblet, would win back his affection.
Other such potions, a little changed, however, would
make sworn lovers separate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Methods of Witchcraft</div>

<p>These dealers in the black art at Pontdebois could also
sell magic rings which had power over demons, thereby
protecting the wearer from sudden death, illness, or
dangers of travel, and enabling him to drive good bargains.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
The witch and wizard also possessed, undoubtedly,
the "evil eye"&mdash;which, if resolutely fixed on an ox
or sheep, would cause it to perish and was almost
as dangerous to human beings. However, the twain
were presently ruined (thus showing how fickle a protector
is the devil) because a certain silly nobleman got
them to "overcast" a knightly enemy against whom he
lacked the courage to press an honorable war. After
the wizard had burned much incense, the witch had
proceeded to shape a puppet of virgin wax as much like
the victim as possible. Then, with a shameless parody
of the baptismal service, she christened the doll with the
name of her patron's enemy. Next the wizard placed
the livers of swallows under the armpits and upon the
place where the heart of the puppet ought to be. Finally,
he and his wife pierced the wax image with red-hot
needles, then cast it into a blazing fire, chanting all the
while cabalistic words&mdash;probably beseeching the special
help of the devil.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Inevitably, soon after this the knight thus assailed
would have sickened and died had not, by the mercy of
God, the whole proceeding been discovered. The knight
was saved by the powerful exorcisms of the bishop. The
wizard&mdash;after proper tortures to get confession&mdash;was
buried alive. His wife, the witch, was burned. The
foolish cavalier who had plotted murder saved his life,
for he had powerful relatives, but was condemned to go
on a pilgrimage to Rome. Certain fatuous women who
had bought love philters were publicly rebuked in the
church and spent an unhappy afternoon in the pillory.
Good Christians hope that it will be a long day before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
the black art is again practiced so iniquitously in this
part of France.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are some forms of divining which
the Church counts as innocent. Any time you desire
you can consult the holy books. With proper prayer and
circumspection you should open the Bible at random
and note the tenor of the first passage that meets your
eye. Is it favorable to your condition, or unfavorable?
The pious Simon de Montfort thus consulted the "sacred
lots" ere taking the cross for the Albigensian crusade.
Chapters of canons use this method to see what the omens
are concerning a candidate for a bishopric. According
to jongleurs' tales, even popes thus seek for an oracle
ere taking any important step in the government of the
Church, although these stories are wisely doubted. A
more precise method of augury is the "<cite>Sortes Apostolorum</cite>."
Fifty-six sentences (expressing sentiments good
or bad) are written on parchment; a string is attached
to each and allowed to protrude while the sentences
are covered up. You say a prayer, seize a string at
random, then follow it down to read its sentiment. In
this way the saints and not the devil will reveal the
future to you.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the peasants carry their belief in bad
omens or unlucky actions too far. Conon and Adela
laugh heartily at some of their notions. To avoid bad
luck, Georges, when weaning a calf, always pulls it
away from its mother by the tail backward. He never
begins plowing until he has walked thrice around the
plow with a lighted candle. Jeanne never spins or sews
on Thursdays or Fridays, lest she make the Virgin weep.
In the springtime a bone from the head of a mare should
be set out in the garden to drive off the caterpillars. Time
fails to list these rustic beliefs; besides, they vary from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
village to village. But what peasant has not as many
thereof as he has hairs in his head?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Universal Adoration of Relics</div>

<p class="mt2">There is one pious matter shared in alike by great and
humble and highly approved by the Church, although
the wiser ecclesiastics deprecate some of its excesses&mdash;the
worship of holy relics.</p>

<p>Saints' relics abound. Where is the monastery,
church, or even castle without them? Sometimes they
rest in golden caskets in the very place where the holy
personages departed this life. Sometimes they have been
brought from Rome or Palestine by pious pilgrims; very
often they come as gifts. The direct purchase of relics
is somewhat sacrilegious, but you can present a king,
duke, or great ecclesiastic with a good relic just as you
give him some hawks or ermine skins&mdash;as a reward for
favors past or expected. The Pope is always sending
desirable relics to bishops and abbots whom he wishes to
honor; and, as all know, after the Latins sacked Constantinople
in 1204 there was hardly a shrine in all
France which did not get the skull, a few ribs, or even
the entire body of some Eastern saint. The booty in
relics in fact, was almost as important as that of gold and
jewels.</p>

<p>Possessing relics is most desirable. Prayers said near
them have extra efficacy. Oaths taken upon their
caskets are doubly binding, but sometimes the holy
objects are surreptitiously removed when the pledge is
being given; it is then no perjury to break the promise.
In dealing with slippery individuals one must, therefore,
beware. On the other hand, who is ignorant of the
manner in which William the Norman inveigled Harold
the Anglo-Saxon into taking a great oath of fealty? The
slow-witted Englishman swore to the pact, believing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
casket on which he rested his hands contained relics of
very inferior worthies, who could never punish him if he
perjured himself; but the instant the words were said
the priests opened the sacred box, showing it full of the
bones of the most powerful saints imaginable. Harold
turned pale with horror, realizing how he had been
trapped. When later he broke his oath, beyond a doubt
it was these angered saints who wrought his death at
Hastings.</p>

<p>Good relics also imply a source of income, provided
that they are properly advertised so as to make the
church or abbey possessing them a pilgrimage resort.
Sometimes, indeed, one fears lest overzealous monks
exaggerate the miracles wrought by the relics at their
abbey church. The tale runs that when the Abbey of St.
Vanne was deeply in debt, the abbot asserted: "Our
debts will all be paid with the red tunic of St. Vanne (a
relic). I never doubt it."</p>

<p>The monks at St. Aliquis are proud of their collection,
although by no means the largest in the region. They
have two teeth of the prophet Amos; hairs of St. Martin
and St. Leonard; finger-nail parings of the martyrs of the
Theban legion; bits of the robe of St. Bernard; finger
bones of Saints Saturnin, Sebastian, and of the Patriarch
Jacob; a fifth rib of St. Amond; a skull of one of the
Holy Innocents; a chip of the stone on which Christ
stood when He ascended to heaven; the jaw bone of St.
Sixtus; some of the hay from the manger of Bethlehem;
and, last but not least, a fair-sized splinter of the true
Cross. The mere adoration of such things cancels many
grievous years in purgatory.</p>

<p>It is advantageous to the whole region to have such a
collection. If there is need of rain, the relics can be
carried in procession around the thirsty country and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
relief is sure to follow. If there is a public assembly,
the holy relics can be brought in before the contending
knights or burghers&mdash;wise counsels will ensue. If you
are going on a journey, a visit to a shrine with such
relics almost guarantees a safe return. We have already
seen how Conon (as did other knights) kept certain relics
always in his sword hilt, to confirm his oaths and to
lend efficacy to his actions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contests Over Relics</div>

<p>The enormous value of such sacred things often makes
them the booty of thieves. Thus in 1219 a band of
robbers stole the remains of St. Leocadia from the Abbey
of Vic, and when pursued cast the holy bones into the
Aisne, whence they were rescued with serious difficulty.
We need not multiply records of similar crimes. Profligate
noblemen will sometimes seize and keep very sacred
relics in their castles, as talismans against long-delayed
justice.</p>

<p>Not less miraculous is the manner in which the relics
have been preserved when less sacred objects have been
lost. This is, indeed, a divine mystery, not lightly to be
inquired into. When, however, two identical relics of
the same saint are displayed in France, how are worldly
questionings to be silenced? For surely the holy men
of old had only one head and two arms apiece. Not long
since, the monks of St. √âtienne exhibited a skull of St.
Denis. But the monks of St. Denis claimed <em>they</em> had
the skull of their own patron saint already. What lack
of charity ensued! The backbiting did not cease till the
great Pope Innocent III tactfully silenced the controversy
without actually deciding which relic was the more
authentic. Many say that such relics can miraculously
duplicate themselves&mdash;so that <em>all</em> are equally genuine;
and undoubtedly God has worked far greater wonders
than this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, such is the sinfulness of men that spurious
relics are often imposed upon the faithful. Good churchmen
do zealous work in exposing these sacrilegious
frauds. Not long since, Father Gr√©goire had Conon give
a terrific flogging to a pretended pilgrim who was trying
to sell the credulous peasants "a bit of the sail of St.
Peter's boat and a feather of the Angel Gabriel." It is
more serious when a spurious shrine is set up. Near
Lyons recently the peasant women insisted in venerating
"the tomb of St. Guinefort." It was discovered to
be only the spot where a lady had buried a favorite
greyhound. In another case, many years ago, the great
St. Martin found near Tours a chapel where the people
worshiped a supposed martyr. The saint stood on the
sepulcher and prayed, "Reveal unto me who is really
here!" Soon a dark form arose and the specter confessed
to Martin: "I am a robber. My soul is in hell, but my
body is in this sepulcher." The saint, therefore, destroyed
the chapel, and saved many from wasting their
prayers and substance.</p>

<p>It is a dangerous business, however, to be over-skeptical
concerning popular relics. Even great churchmen,
such as the late Bishop of Orl√©ans, are liable to be
mobbed if they call an alleged and much-venerated
skull of St. G√©nevieve "the head of some old woman"&mdash;as
once did that astute prelate. Nevertheless, the authorities
try to do their duty. Pope Innocent III has
issued a formal warning to the French clergy against
accepting spurious relics, and the monks of every
monastery never hesitate to dispute the authenticity of
almost every kind of a relic provided only it is deposited
in a neighboring and rival abbey!</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Translations" of Relics</div>

<p>If, however, relics are genuine, it is impossible to
exaggerate their desirability. They are produced on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
numerous holidays; and often a special holiday is proclaimed
when they are "translated." Then you may
see the relics of some saint being carried through the
streets of a village or town, the holy objects themselves
borne in their golden boxes under a canopy, accompanied
by all the local clergy, with perhaps the barons and the
duke of the entire region being allowed to assist the
highest prelates in carrying or at least in escorting the
sacred casket.</p>

<p class="mb2">Thus has been explained certain features of the religion
of the laity, humble and exalted. At length we can
approach one of those great institutions which have
built up the strength of Catholic Christianity. A league
from the castle lies the other great center for the countryside&mdash;the
monastery of St. Aliquis.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIX: The Monastery of St. Aliquis<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>:
Buildings. Organization. An Ill-Ruled Abbey.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_339.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">T</span>he great St. Bernard has written thus
of the convent: "Good is it for us to dwell
there&mdash;where man lives more purely, falls
more rarely, rises more quickly, treads
more cautiously, rests more securely,
dies more happily, is absolved more
easily, and is rewarded more plenteously."</p>

<p>Every now and then they say in the castle of St.
Aliquis: "Such and such a cavalier has become a monk!"
Then there are cries of astonishment and probably
slurring remarks, but even Conon in his heart wonders,
"Has he not, after all, chosen the better part?" at
the very moment when he storms about the "greedy
monks" before his sons. The monastery is the great
interrogation point thrust before the castle. The castle
says: "The hunt, the tourney, the excitement of feudal
war are the things for man. Who truly knows about
the hereafter?" The monastery replies: "There is a
kingdom not of this world, where baron and villein must
spend the √¶ons. Prepare ye for it!" Very probably the
monastery is right.</p>

<p>The monastery of St. Aliquis has existed for centuries.
It is a Benedictine monastery&mdash;that is to say, its rule
(system of government and discipline) comes from the
famous St. Benedict of Nursia, who lived in Italy in the
sixth century. Many new orders of monks have been
founded since then, but none more holy than the Benedictines
when they really live up to the ideals of their
founder. Barons of St. Aliquis and other rich people
have endowed the monastery from time to time with
ample lands. It is a passing wealthy institution.</p>

<p>Ignorant folk of other ages may think of a monastery
as a collection of idlers meditating on heaven and
living on charity. Such groups once perhaps existed
in Eastern lands, but never in a Benedictine monastery.
Each is the scene of a very busy life. Many industries
are carried on. The monks are almost self-supporting.
The monastery, in fact, contributes more to the economic
life of the region than does the castle; and Abbot Victor,
its head, is hardly less important, even in a worldly
sense, than Messire Conon, with whom, happily, he is
now on cordial terms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Abbey Buildings</div>

<p>The monastery, however, is an establishment distinctly
set off by itself. It is in the world, but not of it.
As you travel from the castle, you presently enter
fields unusually well cultivated. These are part of the
abbey lands. Then you come to a small village, comparatively
clean and well built, where the lay servitors
of the monks live with their families. Then straight
ahead there rises a strong battlemented wall of wide
circuit surrounded by a water-filled moat. Beyond
this wall appear the spires and pinnacles of pretentious
buildings. The wall is needed to stand off attacks of
bands of godless men who dream even of plundering
convents. There are a drawbridge, portcullis, and strong
gate. Inside you are within a little world. The center<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
is not the donjon, but the new monastery church, an
elegant pointed-arch structure almost equal to a small
cathedral. Grouped around it are numerous buildings&mdash;usually
long, high, and narrow. These are the dormitories,
the refectory, the cloisters for the monks' walks
and study, as well as many less handsome barns, storehouses
and workhouses. There is a good-sized garden
where rare herbs and flowers are tended with loving
care, and an orchard where fruit trees are grafted with
unusual skill. One even sees a slaughterhouse in a
convenient corner, a tannery (at a safe distance from
the garden!) and a building where the monks' garments
can be spun and woven out of flax and wool produced
on the abbey lands. The monks of St. Aliquis are,
therefore, anything but droning hermits.</p>

<p>Some monasteries really comprise small towns. The
famous establishment at Cluny harbors four hundred
monks; that at Clairvaux, seven hundred; that at
Vezelay, eight hundred. St. Aliquis is content with
one hundred and fifty brethren, but that number
(plus the lay servitors) is enough for a busy community.
As has been said, the focus for its entire life
is the abbey church. Without a church building a
monastery is almost impossible. The choir is constantly
needed for the recitation of the canonical hours; many
altars are required so that the monks who are in holy
orders may celebrate mass frequently; while the great
processions around the nave are part of the routine,
especially on Sundays. Abbot Victor, like all his
predecessors, is straining every nerve to gather funds
to beautify his church. In it are deposited invaluable
saints' relics. It is hard, however, to convince the laity
that they are extremely sacred unless they are lodged
in a splendid edifice. The monks of rival monasteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
are always comparing their churches enviously. Victor
has set his heart upon widening the transepts and
putting in a new rose window. If only a certain pious
heiress in Champagne would be called to heaven!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Abbey Cloisters</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_343"></a>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">THE GALLERIES OF THE CLOISTER OF THE ABBEY OF MONT-SAINT-MICHEL
(THIRTEENTH CENTURY)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the choir is a long array of stalls, one for each
monk in order of seniority. The abbot sits in a chair of
state on the southern side; the prior, his chief lieutenant,
faces him on the north. Connected with one transept
of the church is the cloister. It is a rectangular court.
Its four walks are roofed in, the walls nearest the court
being pierced with open arcades. The pillars upholding
these arcades are beautifully carved with floreated
capitals, each separate pillar forming an individual work
of art, lovingly executed, and differing slightly from its
neighbors. The three walks of the cloister which do not
touch the church adjoin very needful buildings&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
chapter house, where the brethren congregate, the refectory
on the side opposite the church, and the
dormitory. The walk nearest the church is where the
monks are supposed to spend the time allotted for pious
meditation. It faces the south, and the great structure
behind cuts off the chilling winds. It is, therefore, a
pleasant place in cold weather. On the inner side of
this part of the cloister are many little alcoves let into
the massive walls; here monks can study or even converse
without annoying others.</p>

<p>Looking down upon the cloister court is a remarkable
object. If holy brethren did not possess it, the peasants
would declare it was possessed by a devil, although these
mechanisms are now becoming more common. It has a
dial marking the twelve hours, and by an ingenious
system of pulleys and weights indicates when it is noon
or midnight without reference to the shifting of shadows
or movement of the stars. It even has bells that ring
every hour&mdash;a great convenience.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The monks are almost
as proud of this device as of some of their less important
saints' relics.</p>

<p>The books which consume so much of the monks'
time are kept in cupboards in the cloister alcoves,
since this is not a Cistercian monastery, which always
has a separate library. From the cloister one is naturally
led to the chapter house. Almost as much care
has been taken with this large oblong chamber as with
the church. The ceiling is beautifully groined and
vaulted. The abbot sits on a raised seat at the east
end, with all his officers at right or left. The remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
of the brethren are on stone benches ranged around
the walls, while in the center of the floor stands a desk,
whence the daily "lection" is read from the lives of
the martyrs, or the chapter (hence the name of the
room) from St. Benedict's holy Rule&mdash;a document only
a little less authoritative with the monks than the
actual Scriptures.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_345"></a>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">THE REFECTORY AT THE ABBEY OF MONT-SAINT-MICHEL

</div>
</div>

<p>Then come other rooms. The cloisters are <em>supposed</em>
to be extremely quiet for study and meditation. But
sinful flesh requires an outlet. Go then to the parlor
(the place of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">parle</i>), a good-sized room where merchants
can bring their wares. The subprior can discuss the
sickness of certain
pigs on the farms,
and the saints know
how much personal
gossip can be tossed
about. Next is the
dormitory, a large
open apartment with
the beds of the monks
standing against the
walls between the
numerous windows,
so that the feet of the
sleepers point in two
long rows toward the
center line of the room.
A quiet place, but at
night, with several
score of brethren all
snoring together, what repose is left for the stranger?
In any case, there is very little privacy, for few of the
monks have separate bedrooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Refectory, Kitchens and Infirmary</div>

<p>Close by the cloister is the refectory&mdash;an aisleless hall
with a wooden roof. Across the east end is a high table
for the officers&mdash;the whole place resembling the great
hall in a castle. Most of the brethren sit at very long
tables running up and down the apartment; and near
the high table is a still higher pulpit mounted by a winding
stair. Here a monk will droningly read a Latin homily while
his associates are expected to eat and hearken in silence.</p>

<p>The kitchen with its great fireplaces adjoins the
refectory. At the entrance to the dining hall, just as in
the castle, there is the lavatory, a great stone basin with
many taps, convenient for washing the hands. Since
some brethren are sure to be sick, there is a separate
infirmary, a well-arranged suite with places for sleeping,
dining, and even a little chapel for those too feeble <ins title="Transcriber's Note: duplicate 'to' removed">to</ins>
get to the church.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The abbot has lodgings of his
own where he can entertain distinguished visitors,
although he is expected to mingle freely with his fellow
monks and not to assume solitary grandeur. The less
exalted guests are put in a special <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hospitium</i> in the
court. The monastery never turns away any decently
behaving wayfarer; but the guest master, a canny old
religious, naturally provides better quarters and supper
for those likely to put a denier in the alms box than
for those who may have just fled the provost.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span></p>
<p>This is a bare summary of the important buildings of
the establishment. If St. Aliquis had been a Cistercian
convent, following the rule of St. Bernard of Clairvaux,
its structures would have been extremely plain&mdash;no
mosaics, stained glass, silken hangings, or floral carvings
in the church; nor anything else calculated to distract
the monks from thinking upon the
heavenly mysteries. Said he, austerely:
"Works of art are idols which
lead away from God, and are good at
best to edify feeble souls and the
worldly." Bernard was a mighty saint,
but all do not follow this hard doctrine.
The monks of St. Aliquis, for
their own part, are sure that the
Heavenly Ones are rejoiced every time
they add a new stone leaf to the unfading
foliage about the cloister arches,
or carve the story of David and Jonathan
upon the great walnut back to
the prior's seat in the chapter house.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 238px;"><a id="i_347"></a>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A BENEDICTINE MONK (THIRTEENTH CENTURY)</p>
<p class="center">From a manuscript in

He is clad in a frock,
a robe supplied with
ample sleeves and a

</div>
</div>

<p>The monks of St. Aliquis, being
Benedictines, are "black monks." If
they had been Cistercians they would
have been "white monks"&mdash;that is,
with white frocks and cowls. The cowl
is a cumbersome garment enveloping
the whole body, but it is worn only at
ceremonies. Ordinarily the monks wear black scapularies,
covering head and body less completely. They also have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
short mantle-style capes. New outer garments are issued
to them every year, new day shoes every eighteen
months, new boots once in five years, and a new pair
of woolen shirts once in four years. They are also
granted both a thin and a thick tunic, a fur-lined coat
for cold weather, also undershirt and drawers&mdash;in short,
no silly luxuries, but no absurd austerities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Abbot: Center of Monastic Life</div>

<p>The control of the whole community rests with the
abbot. Under the monastic rule and vows the monks
owe him implicit obedience. If he is a practical, efficient
man, the whole establishment is happy and prosperous;
if the reverse, it is soon in debt, the property is wasted,
the monks live evilly or desert; and the whole place often
is ruined. Abbeys resemble seigneuries&mdash;they are either
growing or dwindling. Many church canons forbid abbots
to abuse their office, to live luxuriously, to waste
the abbey property, or to take important steps without
consulting the older monks, but such decrees are hard
to enforce. Fortunately, the head of St. Aliquis&mdash;Abbot
Victor, is a moderate, kindly, yet withal a worldly
wise man. He was the younger son of a petty noble
and was thrust into the monastery somewhat because
his worldly heritage would have been very small. The
monastic life, however, agreed with him. He became
popular with the brethren of peasant stock, yet never
let them forget that his parents had been gentle. As
prior he knew how to deal with Conon and other seigneurs.
When the old leader died, there had been one cry from
all the monks assembled in the chapter house. "Let
Victor be our abbot!" Since then, despite inevitable
grumblings, he has ruled acceptably, avoiding alike
Cistercian severity and that lax rule which has made
certain monasteries the hatching nests of scandal.</p>

<p>Victor wears on ceremonial occasions a miter with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
gold fringe, although it cannot be adorned with pearls
like a bishop's. He has also handsome gloves (especial
emblems of his office), a crozer (a pastoral staff), and
a ring. His administration is aided by a whole corps
of officers. First of all is the prior, named by the abbot
and the abbot's chief lieutenant, who is his superior's
deputy and general man of affairs.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Next the subprior,
the third in command; then the third and fourth priors,
known as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">circatores</i> because they have to make frequent
circuits of inspection; while below them come the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">precentor</i>, in charge of the singing and chanting; the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sacristan</i>, responsible for the bells, lights, and ornaments
of the church; and all the heads of the kitchen,
storehouses, infirmary, and monastery finances. There
is also the garnerer&mdash;a sagacious monk who collects the
grain due from the abbey lands and either sells it profitably
or turns it over to the storekeeper (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">celerer</i>).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Routine of the Monks' Day</div>

<p>The activities of the monks are multifarious, but
everything is really subordinate to the duty of chanting
the holy offices in the church. The brethren go to bed,
even in wintertime, at sunset. Then by the light of
cressets, bowls of oil with floating wicks, they rise at
midnight, put on their clothes, sit down on stone seats
at either end of the dormitory, and next file in silent
procession to the great, dark church. There they chant
a long service, with the organ rumbling under the gloomy
vaulting&mdash;a service made still longer by the prayers for
the dead. As solemnly as before they file back to the
dormitory and sleep until daybreak in winter, until
actual sunrise in summer; whereupon they all rise again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
go to the church, and chant Prime. Tierce follows
about 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>; Sext at noon; Nones at 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>; and
Vespers at about sundown. This continues every day
through a long life. No wonder the monks all know by
heart their offices for the day and night as given in the
breviary.</p>

<p>After Prime a meeting is held in the chapter house.
A section is read from the Rule, the abbot or priors
call off the work for each monk, individual complaints
can be uttered, and corrections and public reproofs
are given by the officers. At the Tierce service mass is
said; then the morning work goes on until the Sext,
after which the first regular meal is eaten, although
some bread soaked with wine is allowed earlier to the
weaker brethren. Talking during the meal is discouraged,
but there is nevertheless much whispering
while the reader (allowed to eat earlier) tries to center
attention upon the pulpit. The brethren then rise and
sing grace, ending up with the "Miserere," which is
chanted in procession marching through the cloister.
Everybody thereupon retires to the dormitory and enjoys
a siesta until it is time for Nones. Work is next resumed
until Vespers just before supper. After supper there is
another meeting in the chapter house, with more reading
from a pious book. Then once more to the church to
chant Complines; after that (since St. Aliquis is a well-ordered
monastery) all the monks are compelled to go
straight to bed and do not sit up for carnal chatter. All
the doors of the establishment are securely locked. The
officers make the rounds to see that every monk is safe on
his cot&mdash;and so the whole brotherhood settles for the night.</p>

<p>Life in the monastery thus has a strict routine which
soon becomes a perfect habit with most of the inmates.
Of course, monks working in the fields are not required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
to come in for all the daytime offices&mdash;they can drop
their tools when the great bell rings and pray in silence
reverently standing. In nunneries about the same
divisions of time are applied, although chaplains have
to come in to say mass. The one thing impressing
every visitor to a well-ruled monastery is the intense
sense of order as compared with the tumult and coarse
informality characteristic of even the better castle.
To a certain type of mind this regularity is indescribably
fascinating apart from any question of its advantages
in religion.</p>

<p>To ask how the different brethren of St. Aliquis come
to enter its portals is to ask as many individual questions.
The abbot is typical of many companions, who were
placed there because worldly prospects were small and
because they were decently urged by their relatives.
Sometimes the pressure was not mild. There are a few
brethren who seem discontented men without vocation,
chafing against irrevocable vows taken practically under
compulsion, and yearning to be back in the world.
There is also one coarse, scar-visaged old man who was
a robber knight. "Tonsure or the scaffold?" so the
duke had put the question. To such a person the monastery
is nothing but an honorable prison. There are,
however, two or three other elderly ex-cavaliers here
for a better reason&mdash;they have been overwhelmed with
a consciousness of their crimes and are genuinely anxious
to redeem their souls. A considerable proportion of
the monks are gentle, although the majority are non-nobles.
If of the latter class, however, they have been
subjected to searching scrutiny before entrance, to make
sure they will be useful members of the community.
If they are mere clownish peasants, they are often taken
only as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">conversi</i> (lay brethren), who learn a few prayers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
but spend most of their time on the abbey farms and
who do not sleep in the dormitory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons for Becoming Monks</div>

<p>The greater number of the monks have apparently
joined voluntarily in early manhood&mdash;because they are
repelled by the confusion and grubbing hardships of the
world, because they have a hankering for an intellectual
life, and because they are genuinely anxious to deliver
their souls. After a round of f√™tes, tournaments, and
forays, many a young knight has suddenly turned from
them all, announced to his companions: "What profit?
Where will I spend eternity?" said farewell to his
beloved destrer, and knocked at the convent door.
Sometimes he has sickened too late of his choice. More
often in this new world of chants, solemn offices, books,
honest toil, gently spoken words, and quietness he has
discovered a satisfaction not possessed by his brother
who is still messire the seigneur.</p>

<p>In the monastery there are, however, certain very
young boys, who it is to be hoped will prove contented
with their profession. Their parents or guardians have
taken them to the abbot, and in their ward's behalf
have uttered vows that bind the helpless children forever.
"I offer this my son (reads the formula) to the Omnipotent
God and to the Virgin Mary for the salvation of
my soul and the souls of my parents.... And so shall
he remain in this holy life all his days until his final
breath." Earnestly do the wiser brethren pray that
these practically orphaned boys do not become a source
of sorrow to themselves and of discord to the community
in future years.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span></p>
<p>St. Aliquis is a well-ordered monastery. Its monks,
however, point with some pharisaical satisfaction at
certain neighboring establishments. It is well said that
"ten are the abuses in the cloister&mdash;costly living, choice
food, noise in the cloister, strife in the chapter, disorder
in the choir, a neglectful discipline, disobedient
youths, lazy old men, headstrong monks, and worldly
officers." It is alleged that all these evils and worse
ones have existed in the monastery of St. Ausonne, five
leagues away. This community had an excellent name
for sanctity until twenty years ago. Then a foolish
abbot admitted too many "younger sons" who were
being forced in by their relatives. The duke, likewise,
imprudently pardoned a whole gang of highwaymen on
condition that "they should turn religious." Also,
several self-seeking cavaliers deliberately entered the
order, in sinful expectation that family influence could
procure their election as abbots or bishops&mdash;posts of
great worldly consequence. Thus it was that our old
enemy, Satan, entered into St. Ausonne. All accounts
are that he still refuses to be ejected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Disorderly Monastery</div>

<p>The evil tidings of this convent presently spread to
Rome; and the Holy Father, deeply grieved, ordered
the Bishop of Pontdebois to visit the establishment and
restore discipline.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> It was well that he took a troop of
armed sergeants with him, or he would have been
stoned by the furious inmates. The monks of St. Aliquis
lift their hands in horror at the least of the stories
told about his discoveries. Part of the bishop's report
reads like this: "Brother Regnaud is accused of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
uncleanness of life. Bartholom√©e, a cantor's assistant,
often gets drunk and then does not get up for the matins
service. Roger, the third prior, frequents taverns. Jean,
the fourth prior, is an habitual tippler. Morell, another
cantor's assistant, is given to striking and evil speaking.
Firmin, in charge of the abbey lands, does the like, etc."</p>

<p>These charges, however, are mere details. The real
sorrow is that from the abbot down the whole organization
of St. Ausonne has fallen utterly away from the
monastic ideal of a "school for the Lord's service"
(to quote St. Benedict). The abbot has been not merely
very worldly, but very miserly. Recently a jongleur
sought hospitality at St. Ausonne. The monks offered
him merely black bread and water, although their own
supper was far more sumptuous than the "two cooked
dishes and half a pint of wine" allowed by the Benedictine
rule. On leaving the abbey, the minstrel met
the abbot returning from pushing his political fortunes
at Paris. He profusely thanked the prelate for his
monks' noble hospitality, because they had given him
choice wine, rich dishes, and finally presented him with
good shoes and a belt. The abbot returned home in a
rage and caused his guest master to be flogged for
squandering the monastery property. The minstrel, of
course, spread the tale of his revenge, and so indirectly
prompted the visitation of the establishment.</p>

<p>In fine, the bishop reported that from St. Ausonne
many monks ranged the country "with wandering
feet"&mdash;as mere religious vagabonds, levying alms upon
the peasantry, and sometimes bearing letters from their
abbot allowing them to quit the cloister at pleasure.
The abbot himself, defying the canons, would have
elaborate hunting parties with hawks and hounds. The
Church law merely permitted monks to kill rabbits and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
crows dangerous to the crops; but the bishop actually
found a kennel of great dogs and a sheaf of boar spears
within the holy compound. The dietary at St. Ausonne
was fit for a castle. Venison was served on Friday, and
the amount of wine consumed was astounding. Women
are never supposed to set foot within the inner precincts
of a monastery, but, to spare the Church further scandal,
one conceals what the bishop discovered to be the
practice at this establishment.</p>

<p>The St. Ausonne monks, too, have cast reproaches
upon their more honest brethren elsewhere. One of
them, after visiting the St. Aliquis convent, is discovered
to have complained: "One cannot talk in the refectory;
and all night they 'bray' the offices in the church.
The meals are very poor; they give us beans and unshelled
eggs. The wine is too thin and too mixed with
cows' drink (water). No&mdash;never will I get drunk on <em>that</em>
wine. At St. Aliquis it is better to die than to live!"<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
Another brother seems to have drifted round the duchy,
visiting the more disorderly seigneurs, becoming their
boon companion, cozening their women, and boasting
that his ideal of life was "a big salmon at dinner time
and sitting by a fountain with a friendly dame."</p>

<p>With such monks sheer sacrilege in performing the
sacred offices was possible. The story goes that at the
morning office they were all very drowsy. Soon their
heads would fall on the service books at the close of
every line. The choir boys were expected to keep up
the chant; but the latter, impious young mortals, soon
learned how to begin quiet games the moment the last
monk had fallen asleep. Then when the proper time
has expired the boys would all call out loudly "Let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
bless the Lord!" "Thanks be to God!" the monks
would respond, awakening with a start; and then everybody
would go comfortably away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discipline of Unruly Monks</div>

<p class="mb2">The report of the bishop will probably produce one of
two orders from Rome&mdash;either the Holy Father will
appoint a new abbot strictly enjoined to rule the convent
with a rod of iron and to restore discipline, or the
whole establishment will be broken up as hopeless and
its inmates distributed around among other and stricter
monasteries. Cases as bad as St. Ausonne's are rare,
but they breed infinite scandal and provide outrageous
tales for the jongleurs. So long as monasticism exists
there will be institutions afflicted with idleness and
luxury&mdash;"the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes
and the pride of life." Doubtless no monastery is
exempt from evil thoughts and evil deeds, yet it is
pitiful that the saints allow such institutions as St.
Ausonne to exist to bring into contempt the tens of
thousands of monks who are trying to serve God with
sincerity.</p>

The Church usually rejected candidates for regular priesthood who
labored under serious physical disabilities. The monasteries had to
be less arbitrary. Thus they probably obtained more than their
share of blind, semi-invalids, purblind, halt, deaf, etc. In 1161, at
an abbey near Boulogne, there are said to have been so many lame,
one-eyed, or one-armed monks that the abbot refused to admit any
more defectives for thirty years. This was probably an extreme
case.

<p>
For similar reasons many women, unmarriageable through physical
defects, seem to have been placed in nunneries.</p></div>

<h2>Chapter XX: The Monastery of St. Aliquis:
The Activities of Its Inmates. Monastic
Learning.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_357.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">A</span>fter a monk has taken the great vow
"renouncing my parents, my brothers,
my friends, my possessions, and the vain
and empty glory of this world ... and
renouncing also my own will for the will
of God, and accepting all the hardships
of the monastic life," how is he to be employed? For,
as St. Benedict with great sagacity has written, "<em>Idleness
is the enemy of the soul</em>." The ancient hermits
devoted their entire time to contemplation, hoping for
visions of angels; but it is recorded too often that they
had only visions of the devil. "Therefore," continues
the holy Rule, "at fixed times the brothers ought to be
employed with manual labor, and again at fixed times
in sacred reading." Thus, in general, the monks of St.
Aliquis are busied with two great things, <em>work</em> in the
fields and <em>study</em>, with the copying or actual writing of
profitable books.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bequests to Monasteries</div>

<p>The monastery being passing rich, its administration
constitutes a great worldly care. Ever since the institution
came into existence, about the time that Heribert
rendered the region fairly safe by erecting his fortress, the
monks have been adding to their property. Church
foundations never die. Mortmain prevents them from
crumbling. Income is obtainable from many sources, but
probably the best lands have come to the abbey through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
the reception of new members. Few novices are received
unless they make a grant of their entire possessions to
the institution, and, while most younger sons and peasants
have little enough to give, every now and then the
abbey receives a person of considerable wealth. Besides
such acquisitions, there is no better way for laymen to
cancel arrears with the recording angel than by gifts of
land or money to an abbey. Some of these gifts come
during lifetime, sometimes on one's deathbed. Noblemen
complain that the monks thus defraud them of their
possessions. "When a man lies down to die," bewails the
epic poem "Hervis de Metz," "he thinks not of his sons.
He summons the black monks of St. Benedict and gives
them his lands, his revenues, his ovens, and his mills.
The men of this age are impoverished and the clerics
daily grow richer." Often, too, a person when on his
deathbed will actually "take the habit" and be enrolled
as a monk, thus, of course, conveying to the abbey all
his possessions. This, we are told, is "the sweetest way
for a human conscience to settle its case with God."</p>

<p>Property thus comes to an abbey from every direction.
No gifts are refused as "tainted money." Giving to
Heaven is invariably a pious deed, and ordinarily justifies
whatever oblique means were used to get the donation.
So the monks of St. Aliquis have been accumulating
tillage lands, meadows, vineyards, and often the rentals
for lands held by others. These rentals are payable in
wheat, barley, oats, cattle and also in pasture rights.
Some donations are given unconditionally, some strictly
on condition that the income be used in providing alms
for the poor, lodgings and comforts for the sick, or saying
special masses for the repose of the soul of the benefactor.
Abbot Victor has therefore to supervise many farms,
forests, mills, etc., scattered for many miles about. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
also receives the tithe (church tax) for five or six parish
churches in the region, on condition that he appoint
their priests and support them out of part of this income.</p>

<p>For these lands the abbot owes feudal service, and over
them he exercises feudal suzerainty, possessing, therefore,
an overlord and also vassals, just as did the nobles
who held these same fiefs before they passed to the abbey.
He is, accordingly, a regular seigneur, receiving and doing
homage, bound to do justice to his vassals, and able to
call them to arms whenever the secular need arises.
By church law he cannot, of course, lead them in person
to battle, but has to accept Conon as his advocate; and
it is as advocate (or, as called elsewhere, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vidame</i>) of the
abbey of St. Aliquis, able to lead its numerous retainers
into the field and act in military matters as the abbot's
very self-sufficient lieutenant and champion, that the
baron owes much of his own importance.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> For example,
he gets one third of all the fees payable to the abbey for
enforcing justice among its dependents, and when he is
himself in a feud he will sometimes attempt to call out
the abbot's vassals to follow his personal banner, even
if the quarrel is of not the least concern to the monks.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, such an overpowerful champion is
usually necessary to a monastery. Despite the fear of
excommunication, unscrupulous lords frequently seize
upon abbey lands or even pillage the sacred buildings,
trusting to smooth over matters later by a gift or a
pilgrimage. The temptation presented by a rich, helpless
monastery is sometimes almost irresistible.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Monastic Industries and Almsgiving</div>

<p>In nonmilitary matters, however, the monks control
everything. They direct the agriculture of hundreds of
peasants. They maintain real industries, manufacturing
far more in the way of church ornaments, vestments,
elegant woolen tapestries, elaborate book covers,
musical instruments, enameled reliquaries, as well as
carvings in wood, bronze, and silver, than they can
possibly use for their own church. All this surplus is
sold, and the third prior has just returned from Pontdebois
to report his success in disposing of a fine bishop's
throne, which Brother Octavian, who has great skill with
his chisel, has spent three whole years in making. The
monks also maintain a school primarily for lads who
expect to become clerics, but which is open also to the
sons of nobles, and, indeed, of such peasants as can see
any use in letting hulking boys who do not expect to
enter the Church learn Latin and struggle with pothooks
and hangers.</p>

<p>The monks, too, have another great care and expense&mdash;the
distribution of alms, even more lavishly than at the
castle. The porter is bound always to keep small
loaves of bread in his lodge, ready to give to the itinerant
poor. Every night swarms of travelers, high and low,
have to be lodged and fed by the guest master, with
none turned away unless he demands quarters a second
night&mdash;when questions will be asked.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> In bad years the
monasteries are somehow expected to feed the wretched
by thousands. All this means a great drain upon the
income, even if the monks themselves live sparely.</p>

<p>There is often another heavy demand made on the
abbot's revenues. Having so many and such varied
parcels of land, he is almost always involved in costly
lawsuits&mdash;with rival church establishments claiming the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
property, with the heirs of donors who refuse to give up
their expected heritages, with creditors or debtors in the
abbey's commercial transactions and with self-seeking
neighboring seigneurs. "He who has land has trouble"
is an old proverb to which Victor cheerfully subscribes.
He is not so litigious as many abbots; but his time
seems consumed with carnal matters which profit not
the soul.</p>

<p>The activities in a large, well-ordered monastery are
ample enough to give scope to the individual genius of
about all the brethren, although every abbey is likely to
have its own special interests. Some South French
monasteries make and export rare cordials and healing
drugs. Others boast of their horticulture, the breeding
of cattle, or the manufacture of various kinds of elegant
articles, as already noted. However, the mere cultivation
of the fields, where the brethren toil side by side
with the lay helpers, although also acting as overseers,
consumes the energies of much of the convent. The
remainder of the time of most monks is devoted to forms
of learning. The great establishment of Cluny sets the
proper example. There every brother, at least while he
is young, must practice humility by digging, pulling
weeds, shelling beans, and making bread. But this work
is largely for discipline.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> If he has the least inclination
he will soon be encouraged to devote himself to copying
manuscripts, studying books, perfecting himself in
Latin, and finally, in actually writing original Latin
works himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Manuscript Copying and Study</div>

<p>All day long, save at the times for chanting the offices,
the older brethren and many of the younger are in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
little alcoves round the cloister, conning or copying
huge volumes of parchment or vellum, or whispering
together over some learned problem. All the formal
literature is in Latin. It was,
until recently, something of a
disgrace to prove oneself unclerkly
by using the vulgar tongue,
"Romance" being accounted fit
only for worldly noblemen and
jongleurs.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p>At St. Aliquis, as in every convent,
monks still are wont to argue
among themselves, "How far is it
safe to study pagan rather than
Christian writers?" Undoubtedly
Horace, Ovid, and Livy are a delight
to any student who can read
Latin. What wealth of new ideas!
What marvelous vigor of language!
What vistas of a strange,
wonderful world are opened to
the imagination! Unfortunately,
however, all these authors died
worshiping demons; their souls
are in hell, or at least in limbo, its uppermost and
least painful compartment. Did not Pope Gregory I
write to a bishop who was fond of classical studies, "It
behooves not that a mouth consecrated to the praise
of God should open for those of Jupiter"? Did not
Odilon, abbot of Cluny, renounce his beloved Virgil (the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
most favored of all heathen writers) after a warning
dream, beholding therein a wondrous antique vase,
which as he reached to grasp it, proved full of writhing
serpents? Nevertheless, the pagan authors are so seductive
that the monks persist in studying them, although
always with a guilty feeling that "stolen waters are
sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant."</p>

<p>In the monastery school advanced instruction is given
to the younger monks, as well as to the very few laymen
who have been through the primary instruction in the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">trivium</i>&mdash;grammar, rhetoric, and dialectics (the art of
reasoning) all taught, of course, in Latin. Apt pupils are
then encouraged to continue under one or two monks of
superior learning in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quadrivium</i>&mdash;astronomy,
arithmetic, geometry, and music. Systematic instruction
is hardly ever given in anything else, although odds
and ends of certain other sciences can be absorbed around
St. Aliquis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Books of Learning</div>

<p>The fundamental textbooks are Donatus's grammar
for instruction in Latin, and then for almost everything
savoring of real learning, Latin translations of Master
Aristotle. For a long time the monks have had to content
themselves with the logical Works of the famous Grecian,
explaining the processes of argumentation, but by 1200
they can enjoy the enormous advantage of using Latin
versions of the Physics, the Metaphysics, and the Ethics&mdash;the
great works of The Master of Those Who Know
(to quote Dante, writing eighty years later). Some of
these books have come directly from the Greek, but others
have been distorted by passing through an Arabic version
that in turn has been made over into Latin. There are
also various Arabic commentaries of considerable value.
Curious it doubtless is that Heaven, who has denied
salvation alike to Greek and to Moslem, should suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
unbelievers to possess a worldly wisdom surpassing
that of good Christians, but the Bible truly says,
"The children of this world are in their generation
wiser than the children of light." On all secular
matters, indeed, Aristotle is a final authority. "Thus
says Aristotle" is the best way to silence every hostile
argument. Only very rarely can a man hope by his
own cogitations to overthrow the dicta of this wonderful
sage of Athens.</p>

<p>A great deal of the monkish student's time is taken up
with abstract problems of philology and logic. Nevertheless,
the abbey contains many parchments widening
to one's knowledge of the world. For example, you can
read in Vincent de Beauvais's <cite>Mirror of Nature</cite> a
minute account of the universe and all things within it.
You can learn the astonishing fact that the world is a
kind of globe suspended at the center of the cosmos.
Many other wonderful things are described&mdash;as, for
example, lead can be transmuted into gold, and all kinds
of wonders which defy ordinary experience, but which
are not to be doubted, since God can, of course, do anything.
Or one can turn to Hugues de St. Victor's treatise
<cite>On Beasts and Other Things</cite> and learn all about
the habits of animals&mdash;concerning how stags can live
nine hundred years and how the dove "with her right
eye contemplates herself, and with her left eye God."
There are books also on medicine, parts of which contain
sober wisdom, worthy of attention by the murderous
physicians, but elsewhere giving such directions as that
since autumn is "the melancholy season," people should
then eat more heartily than in summer and should refrain
from love affairs.</p>

<p>As for the more abstract sciences, in music the monks
know the four principal and the four secondary sounds&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
<i>do</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>, of the scales, the seven modulations and
the five strings of the viol. In geometry they can, with
the aid of a stick, "lying on the ground find the height of
walls and towers." In arithmetic they can multiply and
divide with great facility and keep accounts like a king's
treasurer. In astronomy they understand the motion of
the planets and their qualities&mdash;Saturn, which is "proud,
wise, and ambitious," and Mars, "malevolent and bad,
provoking strife and battles," and how the sun is hung
in the midst of the planets, three above and three below,
and much more similar wisdom; although one must
proceed carefully in astronomy, for its connection with
astrology is close, and from astrology to the black art is
not a long journey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scientific Studies and Chronicle Writing</div>

<p>The good monks have perhaps made their best progress
in botany and geology. Some of the brethren have
gathered collections of curious minerals, of herbs, and
also of dried bird and animal skins; although the interest
seems to be in the healing qualities of various substances
rather than in the nature of the things themselves. Thus
it is certain that figs are good for wounds and broken
bones; aloes stops hair from falling; the root of mandrake
will make women love you; and plenty of sage in
a garden somehow protects the owner from premature
death. As for geology, that consists of the collecting
and arranging of curious stones. It is of course settled
in Genesis that the world was made in a very few days.
The infidel Avincenna has indeed advanced the theory
that mountains are caused by the upheaval of the
earth's crust and by action of water. One must hesitate,
however, about believing this. It seems hardly compatible
with Holy Writ.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the books on animals unhesitatingly
tell about remarkable creatures which are mentioned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
Aristotle or in Pliny or by the Arabs. Unicorns, ph&oelig;nixes,
and dragons are well understood, likewise sea
monsters, as, for example, great krakens, which drag
down ships with their tentacles, sirens or mermaids,
and finally "sea bishops" (probably a kind of seal)
which piously "bless" their human victims before
devouring them.</p>

<p>Besides the study of these older books, the monks are
writing certain books themselves. The most important
is the great chronicle, begun some years ago by the
learned Brother Emeri. It commences with the creation
of the world and Adam and Eve, tells about the Greeks
and Romans and Charlemagne and his heirs, and then
in much greater detail gives the recent history of the
Duchy of Quelqueparte, the happenings at the abbey,
and also much about the barons of St. Aliquis. Emeri is
now dead, but the chronicle is continued from year to
year. It is really a compendium of varied learning.
From it, for example, you learn all about the wars of
Julius C√¶sar, the Crusades, the great lawsuit of ten
years ago over some of the abbey lands, the feud between
Conon and Foretvert, and how in 1216 a two-headed
calf was born on a neighboring barony, and in 1217 a
meteor struck near Pontdebois.</p>

<p>The Latin in this chronicle is, on the whole, very good,
sometimes almost equal to Livy's, and the story is embellished
by constant citations not merely of Virgil and
Horace, but of Homer and Plato. One would suppose
from this that the authors were familiar with Greek.
Such, however, is by no means the case. All the quotations
from Greek authors and many of their Latin ones
are taken from commonplace books. Nevertheless, the
narrative seems the more elegant for this borrowed
learning. The monks are proud of their chronicle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
never fail to boast how much more complete, accurate,
and erudite it is than similar works compiled at the
rival institutions.</p>

<p>When the monks are not actually studying, they are
often copying. St. Aliquis has more than two hundred
volumes in its library. Parchment is very expensive,
but very durable. When the abbot sees his way to
procure material for another volume, he is likely to send
to some friendly convent to borrow a book which his
monks do not yet possess. Then some of the most skillful
brethren are put to work making a copy, if possible
more beautiful than the original. In from six months
to a year the work will probably be finished, although,
if a duplicate is to be made of a work already on hand,
there will be less haste and the process may extend
over years.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Copying is an excellent means of propitiating Heaven.
St. Bernard said emphatically, "Every word which you
write is a blow which smites the devil," and Cassiodorus,
much earlier, asserted: "By the exercise of the mind
upon the Holy Scriptures you convey to those who
read a kind of moral instruction. You preach with
the hand, converting the hand into an organ of
speech&mdash;thus, as it were, fighting the arch-fiend with
pen and ink."</p>

<p>Parchment, we have said, is a costly article. To provide
a single book scores of sheep must die. A new style
of writing material, however, is just coming into vogue.
Paper, a substance made of linen cloth, now is being
produced in small quantities in France, although, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
usual, it seems to have been an invention of the Arab
Infidels. Some day, perhaps, paper will become so
plentiful and cheap that books can be multiplied in
vast numbers, but as yet practically everything has to
be on parchment, which is certainly far less destructible
than paper, whatever the cost.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Elegant Manuscripts and Binding</div>

<p>In the cloister alcoves a dozen copyists are pursuing
their task with infinite patience. Their question is not
"how fast?" but "how well?"&mdash;for they are performing
"a work unto God." As a rule, they write their sheets
in two columns, making their characters either in roundish
minuscule or in squarer Gothic. The initials are in
bright colors&mdash;some with a background of gold. Here
and there may be painted in a brilliant miniature illustration.
The work of the best copyists is beautifully
legible. The scribes put their heart and soul into their
productions. They expect the volumes will be memorials
to their faithfulness and piety scores of years after they
are departed.</p>

<p>When the sheets are completed, the book is bound in
leather much the same as in other ages, although sometimes
the sides are of wood. In any case, there are likely
to be metal clasps and bosses of brass upon the covers.
A few of the most precious volumes are adorned with
plates of silver or carved ivory. So year by year the
library grows. It need not be remarked that every copy
is <em>read</em> and <em>reread</em> with devoted thoroughness. What
the learning of the Feudal Age, therefore, lacks in
breadth is somewhat compensated for by intensity. The
older and more studious monks know almost by heart
<em>all</em> the facts in their entire collection. The younger
brethren revere them as carrying in their own heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
practically everything significant in the way of worldly
wisdom.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p class="mb2">Thus we catch some glimpse of the superficial and
material side of a typical monastic establishment. Into
its spiritual and intellectual atmosphere we cannot find
time to penetrate. Our present duty is to "return to
the world" and to examine the oft-mentioned but as
yet unvisited Good Town of Pontdebois.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXI: The Good Town of Pontdebois:
Aspect and Organization.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_370.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">A</span>s the summer advances, Conon, his
baroness, and his familiars make their
annual visit to the great fair always held
at this time at Pontdebois. Practically
nothing except wheat, cattle, and a few
like staples are ordinarily bought and
sold in or around St. Aliquis. Of course, a messenger can
be sent to the town for articles that are urgently needed,
but, as a rule, the baron's family saves up all its important
purchases until the fair, when many desirable things not
ordinarily to be had in the city are put on sale. This present
season the fair seems the more important because
on account of the expensive f√™tes Conon cannot afford to
visit Paris and must make his purchases nearer home.</p>

<p>It is only a few leagues to Pontdebois, but messire
travels with a considerable retinue&mdash;at least twenty
men at arms well equipped, besides body servants for
himself and his wife, and a long string of sumpter beasts
to bring back the desired commodities, for the castle
must really stock itself for the year. The baron hardly
fears an attack by robbers so near to his own castle and
to a friendly town, but he takes no chances. The best
of seigneurs disclaim any responsibility for the fate of
travelers who proceed by night, and one sire who controls
some miles of the way has possibly a quiet understanding
with certain outlaws that they may lurk in
his forests and watch the roads without too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
questioning, provided they refrain from outrages upon
important people and make him liberal presents at
Christmas and Easter.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> In any case, a number of merchants,
packmen, and other humble travelers who had
gone safely as far as St. Aliquis, are glad to complete the
journey in the baron's formidable company. Conon
in turn gladly protects them; it adds to his prestige to
approach Pontdebois with a great following.</p>

<p>The roads are no worse than elsewhere, yet they are
abominable; trails and muddy ruts they seem most of
the year, ordinarily passable only for horses and mules,
although in the summer rude two-wheeled carts can
bump along them. To cross the streams you must, in
some places, depend on fords very dangerous in the
springtime. One unfordable river, entering the Claire,
is indeed crossed by a rude wooden bridge. The building
of bridges is fostered by the Church. A great indulgence
was proclaimed by the bishop some years ago when this
bridge was constructed as a pious work, especially useful
for pilgrims. Unfortunately, no one is responsible for
its upkeep. It is falling into disrepair, and already is so
tottering that as men pass over it they repeat those
formulas, "commending their souls to God," which the
Church provides for use whenever one is attempting
unstable bridges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Travelers and Inns</div>

<p>On the journey you meet many humble travelers
obliged to trudge weary miles. There is a poor peasant
seeking a farm now on a distant seigneury. He has a
donkey to carry some of his household gear and one of
the children. His wife is painfully carrying the youngest
infant. The poor man himself staggers under a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
sack. Travelers of more consequence ride horseback,
with a large mail or leathern portmanteau tied on their
beast's crupper. Their burdens are heavy because one
often has to spend the night in abominable quarters,
and consequently must, if possible, carry flint, steel, and
tinder for making a fire, some kind of bedding, and very
often a tent. Along the road, too, are any quantity of
beggars, real or pretended cripples and other deformed
persons, wandering about and living on charity; or blind
men with staffs and dogs. The beggars' disguise is a
favorite one for robbers. The wretches, too, who whine
their, "Alms, Messire! Alms!" and hold up a wrist minus
the hand, or point to where an eye has been gouged out,
probably have suffered just punishments for crimes,
although some of them may have mutilated themselves
merely in order to work on the sympathies of the gullible.</p>

<p>As the party approaches Pontdebois the houses become
better and closer together, and just outside the gate is
a group of taverns, available for those who prefer to
carouse or lodge without rather than within the city
walls. Conon is on terms of hospitality with a rich
burgher who has found the baron's favor profitable, and
he leads his company promptly inside the gates, but
many of the humbler travelers turn off to these taverns.
Adela gives an aristocratic sniff of disdain as they ride
past such places. They are assuredly very dirty, and
from them proceeds the smell of stale wine and poor
cooking. The owners, smooth, smirking men, stand by
the road as travelers come in sight and begin to praise
their hostelries. "Within," one of them is calling out,
"are all manner of comforts, painted chambers, and soft
beds packed high with white straw under soft feather
mattresses. Here is your hostel for love affairs. When
you retire you will fall asleep on pillows of violets, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
you have washed out your mouth and rinsed your hands
with rose water!"</p>

<p>His victims, however, will find themselves in a dirty
public dining room, where men and women alike are
drinking and dicing around the bare oaken tables. At
night the guests will sleep in the few chambers, bed
wedged by bed, or perhaps two in a bed, upon feathers
anything but vermin-proof. In the rear of most inns,
too, there is a garden where guests are urged to carouse
with the unsavory females who haunt the establishments.
The visitors will be lucky if they can get safely away without
being made stupidly drunken and then robbed, or having
the innkeeper seize their baggage or even their clothes
on the pretense that they have not paid their reckoning.</p>

<p>Leaving these taverns at one side, the St. Aliquis
company rides straight onward. Before it the spires and
walls of Pontdebois are rising. The circuit of gray
curtain walls and turrets reaches down to the Claire, on
which barges are swinging, and across which stretches
the solid wooden bridge which gives the Good Town its
name. Above the walls you can see the gabled roofs of
the more pretentious houses, the great round donjon,
the civic watchtower, and, above all else, the soaring
fabric and stately mass of the cathedral with the scaffolding
still around its unfinished towers. Several smaller
parish churches are also visible. The baron's company
is obliged to halt at the gate, such is the influx and
efflux of rickety carts, sumpter beasts, and persons
thrusting across the drawbridge. "Way, good people,"
Conon's squires cry. "Way for Messire of St. Aliquis!"
and at last, not without a cracking of whips to make
these mechanic crowds know their betters, the party
forces a path down the narrow streets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Entering a City</div>

<p>A visit to Pontdebois is no real novelty to the castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
folk, yet they always experience a sense of bustle and
vastness upon entering. Here are eight thousand,
indeed, some assert ten thousand, people, all living
together in a single community.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> How confused even
the saints must be when they peer from heaven and try
to number this swarm of young and old, rich and poor,
masters and apprentices, packed in behind one set of
walls! To tell the truth, the circuit of Pontdebois is not
very great; to render the walls as defensible as possible
and to save expense, the fortifications have been made
to inclose the smallest circumference that will answer.
As a result, the land inside is precious. Houses are
wedged closely together. Streets are extraordinarily
narrow. People can hardly stir without colliding with
others, and about the only real breathing spaces are
the market place and some open ground around the
cathedral. Behind the bishop's palace, also, there is a
small walled-in garden. Otherwise, it appears almost
as if not one green thing could grow in Pontdebois.
The contrast with the open country whence the travelers
have just come is therefore startling.</p>

<p>Even the best of the streets are dark, tortuous, and
filthy. There is almost no paving.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> The waste water of
the houses is flung from the windows. Horrid offal is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
thus cast out, as well as the blood and refuse from the
numerous slaughterhouses. Pigs are privileged as
scavengers, even in the market place. The streets are
the darker because the second stories of the houses
project considerably over the first, the third over the
second, and also the fourth and fifth (which often exist)
over those lower. Consequently, there is almost a roof
formed over the lanes, cutting off rain, light and air.
In the upper stories, neighbors not merely can gossip,
but can actually shake hands with their friends across the
street. All the thoroughfares, too, are amazingly crooked,
as if everybody had once built his house where it pleased
him, and afterward some kind of a bypath around it
had been created! At night these twisting avenues
are dark as pitch. No one can get about without a
lantern, and even with one it were better, if possible,
to stay at home. To prevent the easy flight of thieves,
it is common to stretch many heavy chains across the
streets at night. Notwithstanding, footpads often lurk
in the covert of black corners.</p>

<p>Pontdebois has few quiet residence sections. It is a
community of almost nothing but little shops and little
industries&mdash;the two being often combined under one
roof. The shops generally open directly into the streets,
with their stalls intruding on the public way like Oriental
bazaars. The streets, in fact, seem to be almost the
property of the merchants. Foot passengers can barely
find a passage. Carts cannot traverse the town during
business hours, and Conon's company on horseback
might have found itself absolutely blocked had it not
chanced to arrive almost precisely at noon, when the
hum and bustle very suddenly cease and the worthy
folk of Pontdebois forsake their counters and benches to
enjoy hearty dinners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Rich Burgher's House</div>

<p>As it is, they reach the market place just as the city
hangman has finished a necessary ceremony. One
Lambert, a master woolen weaver, had been caught
selling adulterated and dishonestly woven cloth, contrary
to the statutes of his guild. The hangman has solemnly
burned the offending bolts of cloth before a jeering
crowd of apprentices, while Lambert's offense has been
cried out with loud voice. The man is disgraced and
ruined. He will have to become again a mere wage
earner, or quit the city outright. His misfortune is the
choice news of the hour. The smell of the burning cloth
is still in the air when Conon's party rides by the pillory
and halts at the house of the rich Othon Bouchaut, who
is ready to receive them.</p>

<p>Ma√Ætre Othon is one of the principal burghers. He
has grown rich by importing wares from Venice, Constantinople,
and the lands of the Infidels. It is scandalous
(say some nobles) how he, villein born, with hands
only accustomed to hold a purse or a pen, is able to talk
to a great seigneur without groveling as every good
peasant ought. He and his wife even wear gold lace,
pearls, and costly stuffs on f√™te days, as if they were
nobles; and they are said actually to have broken the
law forbidding non-nobles to wear furs. Very deplorable,
but what can be done? Othon is so rich that he
can stir up trouble even for the duke. Nothing remains
but to speak him fair and accept his hospitality.</p>

<p>This powerful merchant's house is in the marketplace.
It rises five stories high, and is built of beams
filled in with laths, mortar, and stucco. On the ground
floor are storerooms for costly Oriental goods, and desks
where the master's clerks seem forever busy with complicated
accounts. On the next are the rooms for the
family, and, although without the spacious magnificence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
of the great hall at St. Aliquis, Adela remarks a little
enviously that her host's wife enjoys many comforts and
luxuries hardly known in the castle. The upper stories
are full of small chambers for Othon's family, his clerks,
and the younger apprentices who are learning his business.
Before the front door swings the ensign of the
house&mdash;a gilded mortar (in token of the powdered spices
which the owner sells). The houses of Pontdebois have
no numbers. The ensigns serve to identify them. One
of Othon's neighbors lives at the "Crouching Cat," another
at the "Tin Pot," another at the "Silver Fish,"
and so on all through the town.</p>

<p>The house of Othon also appears to be quite new, as
do many others. This, however, is a doubtful sign of
good fortune. Only a few years ago much of Pontdebois
was burned down. The narrow streets, the thatched
roofs, the absence of any means of checking a blaze save
a line of buckets hastily organized, make great fires a
standing menace to every city.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Othon complains that
at any moment he may be reduced almost to beggary by
the carelessness of some wretched scullery maid or
tavern apprentice. He will also say that somehow in the
pent-up city there is greater danger of the plague than
in the country castles or even in the villages with their
dungheaps. A dozen years ago Pontdebois lost a quarter
of its population by an outbreak which spared neither
rich nor poor, before which physicians and religious
processions seemed alike helpless, and which demoralized
the community before the saints mercifully halted the
devastation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">The Communal Donjon</div>

<p>There are only a few stone houses in Pontdebois.
Even the best houses of the citizens are usually of wood
and mortar. Not yet have risen those magnificent stone
city halls which later will be the glory of North France
and Flanders. But on one side of the market place rises
the communal donjon. The Good Town is like a seigneur
(indeed, somewhat it <em>is</em> a seigneur placed in commission):
it has its walls and therefore its strong citadel.
The donjon forms a high, solid, square tower dominating
the public square. At its summit there is always a
watchman ready, at first danger of fire or attack, to
boom the alarm bell. The tower itself is large enough to
have good-sized rooms in its base. Nearest the ground is
the council chamber where the worshipful echevins can
deliberate. Above that is the archive room, where the
elaborate town records are kept. Directly under the
council chamber, however, is the prison, where general
offenders are mewed up no more comfortably than in the
abysses of St. Aliquis.</p>

<p>The soul of the communal donjon, however, hovers
around its bells. There in the dark tower hang shrill
Jacqueline, loud Carolus, and, deepest and mightiest of all,
Holy Trinity, and several others. A peal of powerful
bells pertains to every free town. Of course, they ring
lustily and merrily on holidays; indeed, strangers to the
city think they are rung too often for repose.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> But if
they all begin leaping and thundering together, that is
probably a sign for a mass meeting of the citizens in the
open plaza before the donjon. The magistrates may wish
to harangue the populace from the balcony, just above
the council room, descanting upon some public danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
or deliver a peaceful explanation of some new municipal
ordinance. In any case, a commune without its donjon
and bells is like a ship without its rudder, and if ever
Pontdebois succumbs to superior power, the first step of
the conqueror will probably be to "take away the bells"&mdash;that
will be the same thing as annulling the city liberties.</p>

<p>Pontdebois has been a Good Town with a charter
of privileges for about a hundred years. As early as
Charlemagne's day a village existed upon the site. The
location proved good for trade, but the inhabitants,
despite success in commerce and industry and increasing
numbers, were for a long time mere villeins
dependent upon the lord bishop of the town and region,
and with no more rights than the peasants of the fields
had. However, in dealing with men who were steadily
becoming richer, and who were picking up strange ideas
by foreign intercourse, it proved much harder to keep
them content with their station than it did the run of
villeins. Besides, the dukes of Quelqueparte, although
very loath to grant privileges to their own villeins, were
not averse to having privileges given to the subjects of
such independent and unreliable vassals as the bishops
of Pontdebois. Consequently, when the townspeople
about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1100 began raising the cry, "Commune!
Commune!" in the episcopal presence, the bishop could
not look to his suzerain for much support. Indeed, it
was being realized by intelligent seigneurs that granting a
charter to a town often meant a great increase of wealth,
so that if the lord's fiscal rights were carefully safeguarded,
he was actually the gainer by an apparent
cession of part of his authority. The upshot was that
about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1110, when a certain bishop needed a large
purse to cover his travel to the Holy Land, for a round
sum the townsfolk bought from him a charter&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
precious document which practically raised them out
of the status of villeins and protected them against those
executions and tyrannies which the run of peasants had
to accept resignedly, as they did bad winters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charter of a Commune</div>

<p>This charter read in part much as follows: "I, Henri,
by the grace of God Bishop of Pontdebois, make known
to all present and to come, that I have established the
undermentioned rules for the inhabitants of my town of
Pontdebois. Every male inhabitant of said town shall
pay me every year twelve deniers and a bushel of oats
as the price of his dwelling; and if he desires to hold land
outside the walls four deniers per year for each acre.
The houses, vines, and fields may be sold and alienated
at the pleasure of the holder. The dwellers in this town
shall go neither to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ost</i> (feudal levy) nor on any other
expedition unless I lead the same in person. They are
allowed six echevins to administer the ordinary business
of the town and to assist my provost in his duties. I
especially decree that no seigneur shall withdraw from
this town any inhabitants for any reason, unless they
are actually 'his men' or owe him arrears in taxes, etc."<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>After securing this charter, the men of Pontdebois
began to hold up their heads in a manner grievous to the
neighboring nobles, and even more grievous to the
wealthy clergy, for prince-bishops were often the original
suzerains of the towns, and their authority was the most
seriously curtailed.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The books are full of the wrath of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
the ecclesiastics over the changed situation. "'Commune!'
a name new and detestable!" pungently wrote
Abbot Guibert of Nogent, even when the movement was
young; while Bishop Ives of Chartres assured everybody
that "compacts (with city folk) are binding on no
one: they are contrary to the canon law and the decision
of the holy fathers." Even as recently as 1213 a synod
at Paris has denounced communes as the creations of
"usurers and exactors" who have set up "diabolical
usages, tending to overthrow the jurisdiction of the
Church."</p>

<p>However righteous the anger of these holy men, it has
proved vain. The communes ever wax stronger, and
annually some new seigneur is compelled to sell a charter
or even to grant one for nothing. The kings watch
complacently a movement which weakens their unruly
feudatories. Sometimes the townsfolk have grown insolent
and tried to defend their privileges by sheer
violence. Once there was a very tyrannous bishop of
Laon. He foolishly tried to cancel a charter granted the
city, and boasted: "What can you expect these people
to do by their commotions? If my negro boy John were
to seize the most terrible of them by the nose, the fellow
would not even growl. What they yesterday called a
'commune' I have forced them to give up&mdash;at least as
long as I live!" The next day the yell, "Commune!
Commune!" rang in the streets. A mob sacked the
episcopal palace and found the bishop hiding in a cask
at the bottom of the cellar. The howling populace
dragged him into the street and killed him with a hatchet.
Then, to add to this sacrilege upon an anointed bishop,
they plundered most of the nobles who chanced to be in
the town. After such deeds it is no wonder that the
king went to Laon and re-established order with a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
hand. Nevertheless, some years later, a new charter
was granted the town, and the succeeding bishops have
had to walk warily, despite inward groanings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rule by Echevins and Rich Merchants</div>

<p>Fortunately, Pontdebois has been spared these convulsions.
As a rule the local prelates have been reasonable
and conciliatory. The bishop is still called "suzerain."
He receives the fixed tax provided in the original
agreement. He has jurisdiction over the citizens in
spiritual matters, which include heresy, blasphemy,
insults, and assaults upon priests and outrages to
churches. Likewise much of what might be called
"probate litigation"&mdash;touching the validity of marriages
and children, and consequently the wills and property
rights affected thereby. However, in most secular
particulars the citizens have pretty complete control.
They levy numerous imposts, direct taxes, tolls, and
market dues; they enroll a militia to defend the walls
and to take the field under their own officers and banner
when the general levy of the region is called out; they
pass many local ordinances; and they name their own
magistrates who administer "high justice." They can
even wage local wars if they have a grievance against
neighboring barons, being themselves a kind of collective
seigneur. The one thing they <em>cannot</em> do is to coin
money; that is a privilege carefully reserved to the king
and to the superior nobility.</p>

<p>Practically all these powers are exercised by the six
echevins, with a higher dignitary, the mayor (<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">maire</i>),
at their head.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> There is little real democracy, however,
in Pontdebois. The richer merchants, like Othon, and
the more prosperous masters form practically an oligarchy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
excluding the poor artisans and apprentices
from any share in municipal affairs save that of paying
taxes and listening to edicts by the magistrates. The
same officers are re-elected year after year. They use
the town money much as they see fit, refusing public
reckoning and blandly announcing that "they render
their accounts to one another." There are, therefore,
certain discontented fellows who even murmur, "We
'free burghers' are worse taxed and oppressed than are
Baron Conon's villeins at St. Aliquis."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there is often a great desire to become
even a passive citizen of Pontdebois. If you can live
there unmolested for "a year and a day," you escape
the jurisdiction of the lord on whose estate you have
been a villein. You are protected against those outrages
which are possible on even the best seigneuries.
Most of all, you gain a chance to become something
more than a clodhopping plowman. Perhaps your
grandchildren at least will become wealthy and powerful
enough to receive a baron as their guest, even as does
the rich Othon.</p>

<p class="mb2">So one may wander about the twisting streets of
Pontdebois until nightfall, when the loud horns blow
curfew&mdash;"cover fires." After that, the streets are
deserted save for the occasional watchman rattling his
iron-shod staff and calling through the darkness, "Pray
for the dead!"</p>

a mere slough, a choice breeding place for those contagious diseases

to some healing saint, like St. Firman or St. Antoine, usually seemed

<h2>Chapter XXII: Industry and Trade in Pontdebois.
The Great Fair.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_384.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">T</span>he St. Aliquis folk have come to Pontdebois
largely to attend the great fair
soon to open, but the more ordinary
articles they will purchase can be found
on sale on any week day. The city is
a beehive of industry. Notwithstanding
much talk about commerce in the Feudal Ages, the means
of communication and transport are so bad that it is only
the luxuries&mdash;not the essentials&mdash;that can be exported
very far. It takes thirty days in good weather to travel
from Paris to Marseilles. It takes sometimes a week to
go from Pontdebois to Paris; and there is no larger
industrial city much nearer than Paris. The result is
that almost everything ordinarily needed in a ch√¢teau,
village, or even in a monastery, which cannot be made
upon the spot, is manufactured and sold in this Good
Town.</p>

<p>Industrial life, however, seems to exist on a very small
scale. There are no real factories. An establishment
employing more than four or five persons, including the
proprietor, is rare. Much commoner are petty workshops
conducted by the owner alone or aided by only
one youthful apprentice. This multiplicity of extremely
small plants gives Pontdebois a show of
bustle and activity which its actual population does
not warrant.</p>

<p>When you do business in a town, simply name your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
desires and you can be directed to a little winding street
containing all the shops of a given industry. There is the
Glass Workers' Street, the Tanners' Row, the Butchers'
Lane, the Parchment Makers' Street (frequented by
monkish commissioners from the abbeys), the Goldsmiths'
Lane, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shopkeepers Crying their Wares</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_385"></a>
  <img src="images/i_385.jpg" width="400" height="369" alt="CLOTH MERCHANTS" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">CLOTH MERCHANTS</p>
<p class="center">From a bas-relief in the cathedral of Rheims (thirteenth century).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>As a rule the goods are made up in the rear of the
shop and are sold over a small counter directly upon the
street, where the customer stands while he drives his
bargain. Written signs and price cards are practically
unknown. The moment a possible purchaser comes in
sight, all the attendants near the front of the shops
begin a terrific uproar, each trying to bawl down his
neighbor, praising his own wares and almost dragging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
in the visitor to inspect them. Trade etiquette permits
shopkeepers to shout out the most derogatory things
about their rivals. Father Gr√©goire, wishing to buy
some shoes, is almost demoralized by the clamor, although
this is by no means his first visit to Pontdebois.
As he enters the Shoemakers' Lane it seems as if all the
ill-favored apprentices are crowding around him. One
plucks his cape. "Here, good Father! Exactly what
you want!" "Hearken not to the thief," shouts another;
"try on our shoes and name your own price!" A
third tries to push him into yet another stall. "Good
sirs," cries Gr√©goire, in dismay, "for God's sake treat
me gently or I'll buy no shoes at all!" Only reluctantly
do they let him make his choice, then conclude a bargain
unmolested by outsiders. In the fish, bread, and wine
markets the scenes can be even more riotous, while the
phrases used by the hucksters in crying their wares are
peculiar and picturesque.</p>

<p>As always in trade, it is well that "the buyer should
beware"; fixed prices are really unknown and inferior
goods are inordinately praised. Nevertheless, the city
and guild authorities try hard to protect purchasers
from misrepresentation. The officers are always making
unannounced rounds of inspection to see how the guild
ordinances are being obeyed.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The fate of the rascally
woolen maker has been noted. Heavy fines have also
been imposed lately upon a rope maker who put linen in
a hemp cord, and a cutler who put silver ornaments in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
bone knife handle. This, however, was not to protect
purchasers, but because they had gone outside the line
of work permitted to members of their guild and trenched
upon another set of craftsmen. Indeed, a very short
residence in Pontdebois makes one aware that within the
chartered commune the question is not, as in strictly
feudal dominions, "Whose 'man' is he?" but "To what
guild does he belong?" Everything apparently revolves
around the trade and craft guilds.</p>

<p class="mt2">Some of these guilds, like that of the butchers, are
alleged to be much older than the granting of the charter;
but it is undeniable that the organizations have multiplied
and grown in power since that precious document
was obtained.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Each special industry goes to the seigneur
(in this city to the bishop) for a special grant of privileges
and for a fee he will usually satisfy the petitioners,
especially as they desire the privileges mainly to protect
them against their fellow craftsmen, not against himself.
In Paris there are more than three hundred and
fifty separate professions; in Pontdebois they are much
fewer, yet the number seems high. Many guilds have
only a few members apiece, but even the smallest is
mortally jealous of its prerogatives. One "mystery"
makes men's shoes, another women's, another children's.
Some time ago the last mentioned sold some alleged
"children's shoes" which seemed very large! Result&mdash;a
bitter law suit brought by the women's shoemakers.
Christian charity among the guildsmen has not been
restored yet. In Paris they say that the tailors are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
pushing a case against the old-clothes dealers because
the latter "repair their garments so completely as to
make them practically new." There will soon be handsome
fees for the kings' judges, if for nobody else.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Division and Regulations of Guilds</div>

<p>Such friction arises, of course, because each guild is
granted a strict monopoly of trade within certain prescribed
limits. A saddle maker from a strange city who
started a shop without being admitted to the proper
guild would soon find his shop closed, his products
burned, and his own feet in the stocks by the town donjon.
The guilds are supposed to be under strict regulations,
however, in return for these privileges. Their
conditions of labor are laid down, as are the hours and
days of working. The precise quality of their products
is fixed, and sometimes even the size of the articles and
the selling price. Night work, as a rule, is forbidden,
because one cannot then see to produce perfect goods,
although carpenters are allowed to make coffins after
sunset. On days before festivals everyone must close by
3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and on feast days only pastry shops (selling
cakes and sweetmeats) are allowed to be open. Violaters
are subject to a fine, which goes partly to the guild
corporation, partly to the town treasury; and these fines
form a good part of the municipal revenue.</p>

<p>The guilds are not labor unions. The controlling
members are all masters&mdash;the employers of labor, although
usually doing business on a very small scale. A
guild is also a religious and benevolent institution. Every
corporation has its patron saint, with a special chapel in
some church where a priest is engaged to say masses for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
the souls of deceased members.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> If a member falls into
misfortune his guild is expected to succor him and especially,
if he dies, to look after his widow and assist his
orphans to learn their father's craft. Each organization
also has its own banner, very splendid, hung ordinarily
beside the guild's altar, but in the
civic processions proudly carried by
one of the syndics, the craft's officers.
To be a syndic in an influential guild
is the ordinary ambition of about every
young industrialist. It means the acme
of power and dignity attainable, short
of being elected echevin.</p>

<p>The road to full guild membership
is a fairly difficult one, yet it can be
traversed by lads of good morals and
legitimate birth if they have application
and intelligence. A master can
have from one to three apprentices and
also his own son, if he has one who desires
to learn the trade. The apprentices
serve from three to twelve years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Apprentices, Hired Workers and Masters</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 220px;"><a id="i_389"></a>
  <img src="images/i_389.jpg" width="220" height="600" alt="A COMMONER (THIRTEENTH CENTURY)" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A COMMONER (THIRTEENTH CENTURY)</p>
<p class="center">From a bas-relief in the cathedral of Rheims.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The more difficult the craft the longer
the service; thus it takes a ten-year
apprenticeship to become a qualified
jeweler. The lads thus "bound out"
cannot ordinarily quit their master under any circumstances
before the proper time. If they run away they can
be haled back and roundly punished. They are usually
knocked about plentifully, are none too well clothed,
sleep in cold garrets, are fed on the leavings from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
master's table, and can seldom call a moment their own
except on holidays. Their master may give them a little
pocket money, but no regular wages. On the other hand,
he is bound to teach them his trade and to protect
them against evil influences. Often enough, of course,
matters end by the favorite apprentice marrying his
master's daughter and practically taking over the
establishment.</p>

<p>At the end of the apprenticeship the young industrialist
becomes a hired worker, perhaps in his old
master's shop, perhaps somewhere else.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> He is engaged
and paid by the week, and often changes employers many
times while in this stage of his career. The guild protects
him against gross exploitation, but his hours are long&mdash;from
5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> to 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> during the summer months. Finally,
if he has led a moral life, proved a good workman, and
accumulated a small capital, he may apply to the
syndics for admission as a full master himself. A kind of
examination takes place. If, for example, he has been a
weaver he must produce an extremely good bolt of cloth
and show skill in actually making and adjusting the
parts of his loom. This ordeal passed, he pays a fee
(divisible between the city and the guild) and undergoes
an initiation, full of horseplay and absurd allegory.
Thus a candidate for the position of baker must solemnly
present a "new pot full of walnuts and wafers" to the
chief syndic; and upon the latter's accepting the contents,
the candidate deliberately "breaks the pot against
the wall"&mdash;a proclamation that he is now a full member
of the guild. The last act is of course a grand feast&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
whole fraternity guzzling down tankard after tankard
at the expense of the new "brother."</p>

<p class="mt2">There is one quarter of the town which the St. Aliquis
visitors hardly dare to enter. Thrust away in miserable
hovels wedged against one angle of the walls live the
"accursed race"&mdash;the Jews. Here are dark-haired, dark-eyed
people with Oriental physiognomies. They are
exceedingly obsequious to Christians, but the latter do
not trust them. These bearded men with earrings, these
women with bright kerchiefs of Eastern stuffs, all seem
to be conducting little shops where can be bought the
cheapest furniture, household utensils, and particularly
old clothes in Pontdebois. In this quarter, too, is a
small stone building which Conon and his followers
wonder that the echevins suffer to exist&mdash;a very ancient
synagogue, for the Jewish colony is as old as the town.
The few Christians who have periled their souls by
venturing inside say the windows are very small and
that the dark, grimy interior is lighted by dim lamps.
Here also are strange ancient books written in a character
which no Gentile can interpret, but by whispered report
containing fearful blasphemies against the Catholic faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Jews and Money Lending</div>

<p>Why are such folk permitted in Pontdebois? Ma√Ætre
Othon has to explain that if God has consigned these
Jews to eternal damnation he has permitted many of
them while in this world to possess inordinate riches.
Some of the most abject-looking of these persons, who
are compelled by law to wear a saffron circle on their
breasts, can actually find moneys sufficient to pay the
costs of a duke's campaign. Every great seigneur has
"his Jew," and the king has "the royal Jew" who will
loan him money when no Christian will do so in order
to wage his wars or to push more peaceful undertakings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
The Jews are indeed hard to do without because the
Church strictly forbids the loaning of money on usury,
yet somehow it seems very difficult to borrow large sums
simply upon the prospect of the bare repayment of the
same. The Jews, with no fear for their souls, do not
hesitate to lend on interest,
sometimes graspingly demanding
forty, fifty and even
sixty per cent.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> This is outrageous,
but ofttimes money
must be had, and what if no
Christian will lend? There
are certain worthy men,
especially Lombards of North
Italy, who say that it were
well if the Church allowed
lending at reasonable interest, and they are beginning
to make loans accordingly. This suggestion, however,
savors of heresy. In the meantime the Jews continue
despised, maltreated, and mobbed every Good Friday,
but nevertheless almost indispensable.</p>

  <span class="caption">MONEY-CHANGERS (CHARTRES)</span>
</div>

<p class="mt2">The great object which brings so many visitors to
Pontdebois is the annual fair held every August in the
field by the river, just south of the town. Then can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
purchased many articles so unusual that they are not
regularly on sale in the city shops, or even at the more
general market which is held in the square before the
donjon upon each Thursday. The Pontdebois fair cannot,
indeed, compete in extensiveness with the Rouen or
Dijon fairs, the famous Lendit fair (near St. Denis and
Paris), nor, above all, with the great Champagne fairs
at Troyes and elsewhere, for these are the best places
for buying and selling in all France. Nevertheless one
must not despise a fair which attracts nearly all the good
folk of Quelqueparte who are intent on gains or purchases.</p>

<p>In some respects the fair has many features like the
tourney at St. Aliquis. Long files of travelers on beasts or
on foot are approaching, innumerable tents are flaunting
bright pennons, and the same jongleurs who swarmed
to make music or to exhibit tricks at Conon's festival are
coming hither also. But the travelers are not, as a rule,
knights in bright armor, but soberly clad merchants.
Their attendants lead, not high-stepping destrers, but
heavily laden sumpter mules; the tents are not given over
to gallant feasting and gentle intrigues, but to vigorous
chaffering for that thing which all knights affect to
despise&mdash;good money. Therefore, although the bustle
seems the same, the results are very different.</p>

<p>There is a special complication at these fairs. In what
kind of money shall we pay? The royal coinage is supposed
to circulate everywhere and to represent the
standard, but the king's power cannot suppress a whole
swarm of local coinages. There are deniers of Anjou,
Maine, Rouen, Touraine, Toulouse, Poitou, Bordeaux,
and many other districts besides the good royal coins
from Paris; also a plentiful circulation of Constantinople
bezants, Venetian zechins, German groats, and
English silver shillings, in addition to many outlandish
infidel coins of very debatable value. To add to the
trouble, there are varying standards for weights and
measures. You have to make sure as to which one is
used in every purchase.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_394"></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Heavy Tolls On Commerce</div>

<p>The "royal foot" is a pretty general measure, but
sometimes it is split into ten, sometimes into twelve,
inches. Still worse is the pound weight. A Paris pound
divides into sixteen ounces, but that of Lyons into
fourteen, that of Marseilles into only thirteen. Clearly
one needs time, patience, and a level head to trade
happily at this fair!</p>

<p>When you consider the number of tolls levied everywhere
upon commerce&mdash;a fee on about every load that
crosses a bridge, traverses a stretch of river or highway,
passes a castle, etc.&mdash;the wonder grows that it seems
worth while to transport goods at all. The fees are small,
but how they multiply even on a short journey! Along
the Loire between Roanne and Nantes are about seventy-four
places where something must be paid. Things are
as bad by land. Clergy and knights are usually exempt,
but merchants have to travel almost with one hand in
their pockets to satisfy the collectors of the local seigneurs.
The result is that almost nothing is brought
from a distance which is not fairly portable and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
which there is a demand not readily met by the local
workshops.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a good fair is a profitable asset to an
intelligent seigneur. The present fair was instituted
seventy years ago by an unusually enterprising lord
bishop. He induced the barons of the region to agree to
treat visitors to the fair reasonably and to give them
protection against robbers. He also established strict
regulations to secure for every trader fair play when
disposing of his wares, commissioned sergeants to patrol
the grounds, and set up a competent provost's court right
among the tents, so that persons falling into a dispute
could get a quick decision without expensive litigation.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
In return he laid a small tax on every article sold. The
arrangement worked well. Succeeding bishops have been
wise enough to realize that contented merchants are
more profitable than those that have been plundered.
"Hare! Hare!" cry the prelate's sergeants on the first
day&mdash;announcing the opening&mdash;and then for about two
weeks the trafficking, bargain driving, amusements, and
thimble rigging will continue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Numerous Commodities at Fairs</div>

<p>The time of a fair is carefully calculated. Many
merchants spend all the warmer months journeying with
their wares from one fair to another. Many of the
traders at Pontdebois have spent half of June at Lendit,
where "everything is for sale, from carts and horses to
fine tapestries and silver cups." The wares at this present
fair are almost equally extensive, although the selection
may be a little less choice. Besides all kinds of French
products, there are booths displaying wonderful silks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
from Syria, or possibly only from Venice; there are
blazing Saracen carpets woven in Persia or even remoter
lands, while local dyers and fullers can stock up with
Eastern dyestuffs&mdash;lovely red from Damascus, indigo
from Jerusalem, and many other colors. You can get
beautiful glass vessels made in Syria or imitated from
Oriental models in Venice. The monks will buy a
quantity of the new paper while they purchase their
year's supply of parchment; and Adela will authorize
the St. Aliquis cook to obtain many deniers' worth of
precious spices&mdash;pepper, cinnamon, clove, and the rest
essential for seasoning all kinds of dishes, even if their
cost is very dear. The spices are sold by a swarthy,
hawk-visaged Oriental who speaks French in quaint
gutturals, is uncouthly dressed, yet is hardly a Jew. It
is whispered he is a downright miscreant&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, an outrageous
Infidel, possibly not even a Mohammedan.
Perhaps he is native to those lands close to the rising
place of the sun whence come the spices. Ought one to
deal with such people? Nevertheless, the spices are
desirable and he sells them cheaper than anybody else.
There are many other unfamiliar characters at the fair,
including a negro mountebank, quite a few Germans from
the Rhenish trading cities, and a scattering of so-called
Italians, mostly money changers and venders of luxuries,
who, however, seem to be really Jews that are concealing
their unpopular religion for the sake of gain.</p>

<p>After the fair commences, many articles are on sale
daily; but others are exhibited only for a short time.
Thus, following the custom at Troyes, for the first day
or two cloths are displayed in special variety; after that
leather goods and furs; then various bulk commodities,
such as salt, medicinal drugs, herbs, raw wool, flax, etc.;
next comes the excitement of a horse and cattle market,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
when Conon will be induced to buy for his oldest son a
palfrey and for his farms a blooded bull;<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> and after that
various general articles will hold the right of way.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_399"></a>
  <img src="images/i_399.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="THE SALE OF PELTRIES (BOURGES)" />
  <span class="caption">THE SALE OF PELTRIES (BOURGES)</span>
</div>

<p>The Pontdebois masters are required to close their
shops and do all their business at the fair grounds in order
that there may be no
unjust competition
with the visiting traders.
Indeed, all business
outside the fair
grounds is strictly forbidden
in order to
prevent fraudulent
transactions which
the bishop's officers
cannot suppress.
Thus, besides the
costly imported
wares, you can get
anything you ordinarily
want from the curriers, shoemakers, coppersmiths,
hardware, linen, and garment venders, and the dealers
in fish, grain, and even bread.</p>

<p>All this means a chaffering, chattering, and ofttimes a
quarreling, which makes one ask, "Have the days of the
Tower of Babel returned?" The sergeants are always
flying about on foot or horseback among the winding
avenues of tents and booths, and frequently drag off
some vagabond for the pillory. They even seize a cut-purse
red-handed and soon give the idlers the brutal
pleasure of watching a hanging. There are a couple of
tents where notaries are ready with wax and parchments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
to draw up and seal contracts and bargains.
Flemish merchants are negotiating with their Bordeaux
compeers to send the latter next year a consignment
of solid linseys; while a Mayence wine dealer is trying
to prove to a seigneur how much his cellars would be
improved by a few tuns of Rheingold, shipped in to
mellow after the next vintage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Professional Entertainers at Fairs</div>

<p>Along with all this honest traffic proceed the amusements
worthy and unworthy. There are several exhibitors
of trick dogs and performing bears. In a cage
there is a creature called a "lion," though it is certainly
a sick, spiritless, and mangy one; there are also male
and female rope dancers and acrobats, professional
story tellers, professors of white magic, and, of course,
jongleurs of varying quality sawing their viols, or
reciting romances and merry <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fabliaux</i>&mdash;clever tales,
though often indescribably coarse. There are, in addition
(let the sinful truth be told) perfect swarms of brazen
women of an evil kind; and there is enough heady wine
being consumed to fill a brook into the Claire. The
sergeants continually have to separate drunkards who
get to fighting, and to roll their "full brothers"&mdash;more
completely overcome&mdash;into safe places where they can
sleep off their liquor unkicked by horses and uncrushed
by constantly passing carts.</p>

<p class="mb2">This bustle continues two weeks. By that time everybody
who has come primarily to buy has spent all his
money. If he has come to sell, presumably he is satisfied.
The drunkards are at last sad and sober. "Hare!
Hare!" cry the sergeants on the evening of the last day.
The fair is over. The next morning the foreign merchants
pack their wares, strike their tents, and wander
off to another market fifty miles distant, while the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Pointdebois'">Pontdebois</ins> traders and industrialists resume their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
normal activity. They have stocked up with necessary
raw materials for the year, they have absorbed many
new ideas as to how they can make better wares or
trade to more advantage; yet probably most of them
are grumbling against "those Germans and Flemings
and Jews whom the bishop turns loose on us. Blessed
saints! how much money they have taken out of the
neighborhood!" But the bishop, when his provost reports
the tax receipts, is extraordinarily well satisfied.</p>

seigneurs went far to explain these astonishing rates of interest.
The chances of an unfriended Jew being unable to collect any part
of his loan were extremely great. As a rule his hopes lay in becoming
the indispensable man of business and financier of a king or other
great lord who would support him in recovering principal and interest
from lesser debtors, in return for great favors to himself. Thus

<p>
A sou, merely a money of account, was equal to about 20 modern
francs ($3.86 gold), and the denier, a regular coin, to about one franc
(19.3 cents, gold). The copper obols were thus worth about one
cent. But money in the Feudal Age had a purchasing power equal
to at least ten times what it is to-day, and attempts at close estimating
are decidedly futile.</p></div>

<h2>Chapter XXIII: The Lord Bishop. The Canons.
The Parish Clergy.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_402.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">A</span>fter Conon and his baroness have
soiled their gentle blood by discreet
trafficking at the Pontdebois fair, the
seigneur must needs pay a ceremonious
call upon the lord bishop. He might
indeed have accepted lodgings at the
episcopal palace, but it is well not to be put under too
many obligations even to so conciliatory a prelate as
Bishop Nivelon. Between the lay and ecclesiastical
lords there are compliments, but little affection. Both
unite in despising the villein and distrusting the monks,
but there the harmony often ends.</p>

<p>The lord bishop occupies almost the apex of the
ecclesiastical power, barring only the Pope and his
cardinals; and all the lay world ought to honor the
clergy. A familiar story illustrates the recognition due
even to the humbler churchmen. Once St. Martin was
asked to sup with the emperor. He was offered the cup
before it was passed to the sovereign. This was a great
honor. He was supposed merely to touch the vessel to
his lips, then hand it on to his Majesty. Instead, to the
surprise yet admiration of all, he gave it to a poor priest
standing behind him, thereby teaching the plain lesson
that a servant of God, even of the lowest rank, deserves
honor above the highest secular potentate.</p>

<p>The clergy is divided into two great sections&mdash;the
religious (the monks) and the secular clergy who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
"in the world" and have the "cure of souls." The parish
priests belong, of course, to this second class. They
celebrate mass and administer the sacraments and consolations
of religion.
They are possibly
reckoned by the laity
a little less holy than
the monks, but their
power is incalculable.
At their head in each
diocese (ecclesiastical
province) is the
bishop. Since the
wealth of the Church
embraces at least one
fifth of all the real
estate of France<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and
the control of this vast
property is largely
vested in the bishops,
it is easy to see what
holding such an office
implies. There is no
seigneur in Quelqueparte
so rich as
Bishop Nivelon, barring
only the duke
himself&mdash;and the duke would justly hesitate, quite apart
from feelings of piety, to force a quarrel with so great a
spiritual lord.</p>

<p>It will be hard for other ages to realize the part that is
played by the Church in the feudal centuries. The
clergy are far more than spiritual guides. They are
directors of education and maintain about all there is of
intellectual life, science, and learning. They help the
weak secular authorities to preserve law and order.
They supply practically all the teachers, lawyers, and
professional nonfeudal judges in Christendom, and very
many of the physicians. As already stated, that multitude
of legal cases known as "probate," involving the
disposal of wide estates, often go directly to the Church
Courts.</p>

<p>If an ordinary man appears interested in literary
matters, he is frequently set down as a "clerk," even if he
does not openly claim to have received holy orders. It is
indeed very desirable legally for a common person (not a
privileged noble) to be barely literate. If he can do this
and is arrested on any charge, he can often "plead his
clergy." The test is not to produce a certificate showing
that he is a priest or monk, but to be able to read a few
lines from the Bible or other sacred book. If he can
read these fateful "neck verses," he may sometimes
escape a speedy interview with the hangman. He is then
ordinarily handed over to the bishop or the bishop's
official (judicial officer) and tried according to the merciful
and scientific canon law, which, whatever the offense,
will seldom or never order the death penalty, save for
heresy.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The worst to be feared is a long imprisonment in
the uncomfortable dungeon under the bishop's palace.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span></p>
<p>With conditions like this, what wonder if very worldly
elements keep intruding into the secular clergy. Many
a baron's son balances in his mind&mdash;which is better, the
seigneur's "cap of presence" or the bishop's miter?
The bishop, indeed, cannot marry; but the Church is
not always very stern in dealing with other forms of
social enjoyment. Sometimes
a powerful reforming
Pope will make the prelates
affect a monkish austerity&mdash;but
the next Pope may prove
too busy to be insistent concerning
"sins of the flesh." A
great fraction of all the
bishops are the sons of noble
houses. Merely becoming tonsured
has not made them into
saints. They are the children
of fighting sires, and they bring
into the Church much of the
turbulence of their fathers
and brothers in the castles.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Certainly, men of humble
birth can become prelates.
It is one of the glories of the
Church that, thanks to her,
the children of poor villeins
can receive the homage of the
great in this world. Pope Sylvester II was the son of a
mere shepherd of Aurillac. Suger, the mighty abbot of
St. Denis and vice gerent for Louis VI, was the son of an
actual serf. Pope Hadrian IV, the only Englishman who
has ever mounted the throne of St. Peter, seems to have
had an origin hardly more exalted. All this shows what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
fortune can sometimes await bright and lucky boys who
enter betimes the convent schools instead of following the
plow.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> But Heaven seldom reverses the natural order.
As a rule, when a noble enters the church, family influence
and the social prestige of his caste will get behind
him. He is far more likely to be elected bishop and to
enjoy the seats of glory than are his fellow clerics,
learned and devout, who have no such backing.</p>

<p>Nivelon of Pontdebois is an example of the average
bishop of the superior kind. He was the second son of a
sire of moderate means. Family influence secured him,
while fairly young, the appointment as canon at the
cathedral. The old bishop conveniently happened to
die at a time when both the duke and his suzerain, the
king, thought well of the young canon and were anxious
to conciliate his relatives. Nivelon, too, had displayed
sufficient grasp on business affairs, along with real piety,
to make men say that he would prove a worthy "prince
spiritual." The canons (with whom the choice nominally
lay) made haste to elect him after a broad hint from both
the duke and the king. Confirmation was obtained from
Rome after negotiations and possibly some money
transfers.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Since then Nivelon has ruled his diocese well.
He has been neither a great theologian nor a man of
letters, as are certain contemporaneous bishops, nor a
self-seeking politician and a mitered warrior like others.
There have been no scandalous luxuries at his palace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
and he has never neglected his duties&mdash;which none can
deny are numerous.</p>

<p>There is plenty of excuse for Nivelon if he allows
religious tasks to be swamped by secular ones. He
apparently differs largely from a seigneur <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'n'">in</ins> that his
interests and obligations are more complex. On his
direct domains are parish churches, abbeys, farms,
peasant villages, and forests which he must rule by his
officials and provosts just as Conon rules St. Aliquis.
He has many noble fiefs which owe him homage and
regular feudal duties in peace and war. His knightly
vassals wait on him, as do regular lieges, and are bound
on state occasions to carry him through his cathedral
city seated on his episcopal throne. He does not himself
do ordinary homage to the king, but he must take to
him a solemn oath of fealty, and assist with armed levies
on proper summons. There are many clergy around his
palace, but also a regular baronial household&mdash;seneschal,
steward, chamberlain, marshal, and equerry, though not,
as with the laxer prelates, a master of the hawks.</p>

<p>So much for Monseigneur Nivelon's temporal side;
but, since he is a self-respecting prelate, his ecclesiastical
office is no sinecure. He has to ordain and control all
the parish priests (cur√©s), and spends much of his time
inspecting the rural churches and listening to complaints
against offending priests, suspending and punishing
the guilty. Indeed, his days are consumed by a
curious mixture of duties. Just before Conon ceremoniously
calls upon him he has been listening first to a
complaint from a castellan about the need of new trenchbuts
for the defense of a small castle pertaining to the
bishopric, and then to the report of his "official" concerning
a disorderly priest accused of blaspheming the
Trinity while in his cups in a tavern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ecclesiastical Duties of Bishops</div>

<p>Once a year Nivelon has to hold a synod in the choir
of his cathedral. All the nonmonastic clergy of the diocese
are supposed to be present, and he has to preach
before them, stating home truths about Christian conduct
and administering public reprimands and
discipline. Often his routine is interrupted
by the commands of the king
that he, as a well-versed man of the
world, shall come to Paris to give counsel,
or even go to England or Flanders as
the royal ambassador. If the king does
not demand his time, the Pope is likely
to be using him to investigate some disorderly
abbey,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> or as arbiter between two
wrangling fellow ecclesiastics. It would
be lucky if a summons did not presently
come, ordering the bishop to take the
very tedious and expensive journey to
Rome to assist at some council (such as
the Lateran Council of 1215) or be party
to some long-drawn litigation.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 194px;"><a id="i_408"></a>

</div>
</div>

<p>A conscientious bishop can, indeed,
be no idler. If he has any spare
time he can always spend it sitting as
judge in cases which if he is compelled
to be absent he deputes to his official.
The canon law is far more scientific
than local customs. Nivelon, or his deputy, has also
a clear understanding of issues which will leave even
so well-meaning a seigneur as Conon hopelessly befuddled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
The Church courts refuse to settle cases
by duels. As a rule, too, they discourage ordeals,
despite the alleged intervention of God therein. Trials in
the bishop's court betake of inquests based on firm evidence
taken before experienced judges. The result is
that many honest suitors try to get their cases before
the Church tribunals&mdash;and, as stated, the jurisdiction
of the Church is very wide. A bishop, therefore, if
he wishes, can put in almost his whole time playing
the Solomon; or, if he prefer, he can almost always
find the estates of the diocese enmeshed in financial
problems which it will tax his best energies to
disentangle.</p>

<p>All these things Nivelon is supposed to do or must
get done. What wonder (considering mortal frailty)
that many men who seek the episcopate for temporal
advantage often bring their great office into contempt?
It is true that sometimes very worldly young clerics,
when once elected, are sobered by their responsibilities
and become admirable prelates. There is a story of
a college of canons which decided to elect to the vacant
bishopric a fellow member "who was excellent in mother
wit," but who, when they sought him to tell of his honor,
was actually dicing in a tavern. Forth they dragged
him, "weeping and struggling," to the cathedral, and
thrust him into the episcopal chair. Once enthroned,
however, he proved sober and capable, thus proving
how, despite his original sins, "the free gift of virtue
which had come upon him (by consecration) shaped the
possibilities of an excellent nature."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evil and Luxurious Prelates</div>

<p>This is all very well, but the sacred honor does not
always work such reformation. The monks never conceal
the faults of the rival branch of the clergy. A
monkish preacher has lately declaimed: "The bishops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
surpass as wolves and foxes. They bribe and flatter
in order to extort. Instead of being protectors of
the Church, they are its ravishers." Or again, "Jesus
wore hair cloth; they silken vestments. They care
not for souls, but for falcons; not for the poor,
but for hunting dogs. The churches from being
holy places have become market places and haunts
for brigands." Most of this is mere rhetoric, and such
sweeping generalizations are unjust. If the majority
of bishops are not ascetics, neither are they rapacious
libertines. Nevertheless, even as one ill-ruled abbey
brings contempt on many austere establishments, so
a few faithless bishops bring scandal on the whole
episcopate. Some years ago Pope Innocent III had to
denounce a South French bishop as "serving no other
God but money, and having a purse in place of a heart."
This wretch was charged with selling Church offices, or
leaving them vacant in order to seize their incomes,
while the monks and canons under him (says the Pope)
"were laying aside the habit, taking wives, living by
usury, and becoming lawyers, jongleurs, or doctors."<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Acts like these have forced the Council of Paris in
1212 to forbid bishops to wear laymen's garments or
luxurious furs; to use decorated saddles or golden horse
bits, to play games of chance, to go hunting, to swear
or let their servants swear, to hear matins while still
in bed, or excommunicate innocent people out of mere
petulance. Bishops, too, are not supposed to bear arms,
but we have seen how they sometimes compromise on
"bloodless" heavy maces. Nivelon occasionally lets a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
secular advocate or vidame lead his feudal levy, but at
times he will ride in person. A bishop, of course, was
King Philip's chief of staff at Bouvines,<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> although in
excuse it should be said he had been the member of a
military monastic order; but Bishop Odo of Bayeux
fought at Hastings (1066) before any such authorized
champions of the Church existed. One need not multiply
examples. That bishops shall genuinely refrain from
warfare is really a "pious wish" not easily in this sinful
world to be granted.</p>

<p>A bishop can, however, justify this assertion of the
Church militant. He must fight to maintain the rights
of the bishopric against the encroaching nobility.
Around the royal domain conditions are reasonably
secure, but here in Quelqueparte, as elsewhere in the
average feudal principalities, it is useless to ask the
suzerain to do very much to defend his local bishop,
the two are so likely to be very unfriendly themselves.
Anathemas cannot check the more reckless seigneurs.
In 1208 the Bishop of Verdun was killed in a riot by a
lance thrust, and in this very year 1220 the Bishop of
Puy (in the south of France) has been slain by noblemen
whom he had excommunicated. The murderers have
doubtless lost their souls, but this fact does not recall
the dead! Jongleurs (who echo baronial prejudices)
are always making fun of bishops, in their epics alleging
that they lead scandalous lives and are extraordinarily
avaricious, even when summoned to contribute for a
war against the Infidels. The truth is, the bishops,
being often recruited from the nobility, frequently keep
all their old fighting spirit. The bishop opposes a
neighboring viscount, just as the viscount will oppose
his other neighbor, a baron. Frequently enough the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
war between a bishop and a lay seigneur differs in no
respect from a normal feud between two seigneurs who
have never been touched by tonsure and chrism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Friction with Abbots and Barons</div>

<p>There are other frictions less bloody, but even more
distressing to the Church. If there is an exempt abbey
in the diocese&mdash;independent of the bishop and taking
orders from only the Pope&mdash;the abbot and the bishop
are often anything but "brethren." Each is continually
complaining about the other to the Vatican. However,
even if the local abbey is not directly under the Pope,
its head is likely to defy the bishop as much as possible.
Abbots are always trying to put themselves on equality
with bishops and intriguing at Rome for the right to
wear episcopal sandals, a miter, etc. So the strength of
the Church is wasted, to the great joy of the devil. It
is counted a sign that the Bishop of Pontdebois and
the Abbot of St. Aliquis are both superior prelates, that
their relations are reasonably harmonious.</p>

<p>However, it is with the nobles that Nivelon has his
main troubles. One of the reasons why Conon wishes
to see the bishop is to complain of how certain St.
Aliquis peasants are being induced to settle on the
Church lands. Villeins somehow feel that they are
better treated by a bishop or abbot than by the most
benevolent of seigneurs. "There is good living under
the cross," runs the proverb. Also, the baron wishes to
urge the bishop not to excommunicate a fellow noble
who is at issue with the prelate over some hunting
rights. It is all very well for the bishop to devote to the
evil one and the eternal fire a really sacrilegious criminal.
The fact remains that many nobles allege that they are
excommunicated, and unless reinstated lose their very
hopes of heaven, merely because they have differed from
great churchmen as to extremely secular property questions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
The fearful ceremony of excommunication is
liable to fall into contempt except when used in the
most undoubted cases. A resolute baron, sure of his
cause, can defy the anathema and, if his followers stand
by him, may hold out until he forces a compromise.</p>

<p>If the struggle is bitter, however, the bishop has
another weapon. He can put the offending seigneur's
lands and castles under the Interdict. Doubtless it is
a harsh thing to deny all religious services and sacraments,
save the last unction to the dying, to thousands of innocent
persons merely because their lord persists in some
worldly policy. Yet this is done frequently, and is, of
course, of great efficacy in getting pious people, and
especially the womenfolk, to put pressure upon their
seigneur to come to terms with the Church. Sometimes
an "intermittent" interdict is established. Thus, for
a long time the Count and the Bishop of Auxerre were
at enmity. The count, a hardened scoffer, was no wise
troubled by excommunication. Then the bishop ordained
that as soon as the count entered the city of Auxerre all
the offices of religion, except baptism and last unction,
should be suspended. The moment he and his men
departed the church bells rang and religious life resumed.
The instant he returned there was more bell ringing&mdash;whereat
the churches were closed. The count did not
dare to stay very long in the city, because of popular
murmurs; yet he and the bishop kept up this unedifying
war for fifteen years until the Pope induced the king to
induce the count to submit to the Church by a humiliating
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'penace'">penance</ins>.</p>

<p>Excommunication and interdict are thus weapons
which a lord spiritual can use against a lord temporal,
to supplement crossbows and lances. Unfortunately
they have fewer terrors against foes which all bishops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
including Nivelon, have within their own household&mdash;the
chapters of canons at the cathedrals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Chapter of Canons</div>

<p class="mt2">To be a canon is almost equal to enjoying the perquisites
of some less valuable bishopric without the
grievous cares of the episcopal office. The chapter of
canons constitutes the privileged body of ecclesiastics
who maintain the worship at the cathedral.</p>

<p>As you go through Pontdebois you see the great gray
mass of the new episcopal church rising ahead of you.
Presently a solid wall is reached, protected by a gate and
towers. This is the cathedral "close," a separate compound
next to the majestic church and communicating
with it by a special entrance. Within this close one
passes under strictly ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Here
is a pretentious residence, the bishop's palace, and a
pleasant garden, and here is also a group of smaller
houses&mdash;the habitations of the canons. These last form
the chapter of canons who enjoy as a corporate body a
quantity of lands, seigneurial rights, officers, and goodly
income quite separate from the bishops. Supposedly
they are controlled by a Rule, but it is a rule far less
severe than that of most monks.</p>

<p>The chapter here, as elsewhere, is largely recruited
from the local noble houses. Church law nominally
forbids it, but the fact remains that many, if not most,
canons are practically nominated, whenever there is a
vacancy in the chapter, by this or that powerful seigneur.
To get a relative a prebend (income from endowment)
as canon is often equivalent to providing for life for a
kinsman to whom you might otherwise have to cede a
castle. It is well understood that since years ago a baron
of St. Aliquis endowed with large gifts a certain prebend,
his successors have the naming of its occupants, as often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
as it falls vacant. After Conon has visited the bishop,
he will pay a friendly call on "his canon," not without
a certain desire to verify the reports that this elderly
cleric is in poor health and not long for the present world.
If such rumors are correct, the baron must consider
whether a certain remote cousin feels summoned to
endure the hardships of a religious life, and what substantial
favors this ambitious cousin and his father
could give Conon for the privilege.</p>

<p>A canon who performs <em>all</em> his duties is hardly idle.
He is supposed to take part in the incessant and often
extraordinarily elaborate services at every cathedral. He
should possess a good physical presence, and intone the
offices with elegance and precision. Every week day
he has to chant through five services, and on Sunday
through nine. On certain great feasts and holidays
there are still more. Anthems, responses, psalms, prayers,
hymns, also public processions should keep him turning
leaves of the ponderous ordinaries and manuals until
he knows every chant therein by heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Worldliness of Canons</div>

<p>It is possible, however, to find substitutes in all the less
important services. There are plenty of humbly born
poor priests hovering around every cathedral, glad of
a pittance to act as the lordly canon's deputies. A
worldly minded canon therefore does not feel this duty
of chanting to be very arduous. Of course, if he is
absent too often, or from very important ceremonies,
there is comment, scandal, and a reprimand from the
bishop; but a wise bishop does not interfere with his
canons except on grave provocation. They form an
independent corporation with well-intrenched privileges.
Their head, the dean, is entirely conscious that he is the
second cleric in the diocese and that he need not look to
the bishop for dignity and glory. The bishop himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
has been to a certain extent chosen by these very canons.
It will depend considerably upon their attitude toward
him whether his dying moments are not embittered
by the knowledge that his dearest enemy is not to be
elected his successor. Finally, a chapter of canons can
make a bishop's life a Gehenna by filing complaints
against him with the archbishop (always glad to interfere),
or directly at Rome. When men say that Nivelon
has got along tolerably with his chapter as well as with
his neighboring abbot and seigneurs, they prove again
that he is an unusually tactful prelate.</p>

<p>It is a fine thing, therefore, to be one of the dozen-odd
canons, young or old, who inhabit the sacred close at
Pontdebois. They can be identified by their special
costume, the loose surplice of linen with wide sleeves
covering the cassock, and by the "amice," a headdress
of thick black stuff with a flat top and terminating on
each corner in a kind of horn.</p>

<p>Baron Conon points out to his sons these well-fed men
of florid complexion, contented and portly, moving with
slow dignity about the cathedral close. "How would
you enjoy being a canon?" he asks of small Anseau, his
youngest boy. "There are no better dinners than those
in the chapter refectory; and remember that your brother
will have to get the castle."</p>

<p>Anseau shakes his head and scowls: "I might be a
monk, yes," he rejoined; "monks save their souls and
go to heaven&mdash;but a canon&mdash;ugh! They must weary
God by their idleness. Fran√ßois may have St. Aliquis;
but let him give me a good destrer and good armor. I
will seek my fortune and win new lands."</p>

<p>"The saints bless your words," cries his father, "there
spoke a true St. Aliquis! And remember this: When
cavalier or jongleur rails hardest against worthless churchmen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
it is not bishop, priest, or monk whom half the
time they have in their pates, but slothful canons. Yet
I must see the Revered Father Flavien, and learn if his
cough <em>is</em> really as bad as they say!"</p>

<p class="mt2">Nivelon secures peace by letting his canons largely
alone&mdash;to their great content. Fortunately, the good
laymen of Quelqueparte do not depend
entirely upon their spiritual administrations.
The "cure of souls" rests
with the parish priests. These are
scattered all through the diocese. Their
management takes up a large part of
the bishop's crowded time.</p>

</div>

<p>Every church requires at least one
priest in residence to say mass and
afford religious comfort to the laity. If
competent bishops could always have
appointed this clergy, much sorrow
would have been eliminated. Unfortunately,
the bishop can only name a
fraction. Practically every noncathedral
church has its patron, the heir or beneficiary
of the wealthy personage who
once endowed the local establishment.
This patron may be the bishop himself,
but often the honor may be enjoyed by
an abbey, or a chapter of canons, or, in a
majority of cases, by some very secular
seigneur. Conon will say. "I hold the
patronage of eight churches," just as he will say, "I
hold St. Aliquis castle." The patron is entitled to a
share of the tithe (tax for religious purposes) and other
income of the parish, before turning the remainder over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
to the officiating priest. He can, in addition, "present
to the living"&mdash;that is, name the new cur√© for the parish
upon every vacancy. The bishop is supposed, indeed,
to confirm the candidate, and should not do so without
investigation as to the other's fitness, but he will
hesitate to offend the patron by refusal to proceed with
the ceremony unless the impediment is gross and patent.
The candidate is asked to decline a Latin noun, to
conjugate a simple verb, to chant a few familiar psalms
with fair voice&mdash;that is probably about all the test for
learning. To make matters worse, if the candidate fears
his own bishop, he can go to another diocese and probably
get a licence from a less exacting prelate. A bishop
is obliged to honor the certificate issued by his equal.
He can seldom then refuse after that to invest the priest
with the parish.</p>

<p>The last stage of scandal comes when the patron
actually takes money for presenting a candidate. This
is, of course, a terrible crime against the Church: it
is simony&mdash;after the fashion of the accursed Simon
Magnus, who was guilty of trying to purchase "the gift
of God with money." Nivelon has just had to induct
into a parish an ill-taught, worldly fellow, the son of a
rich peasant, who somehow persuaded the Viscount of
Foretvert that he was fit to have the spiritual conduct
of five hundred Christians. The bishop has heard ugly
rumors about "two hundred deniers," yet for lack of real
proof is helpless. It is feared these scandals are frequent,
but many times, if candidate and seigneur are willing
to imperil their souls, what can be done?</p>

<p>As a rule, however, conscientious patrons name well-reputed
lads from their barony, the sons of thrifty
peasants or of petty nobles, who have been to the school
attached to a convent or cathedral, and who have developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
an aptitude for saying masses rather than for
plowing or fighting. The favor is bestowed rather as a
reward for faithful service by the youth's family or to
insure the same in the future, than for any direct money
consideration. To be a parish priest is not a very high
honor. After the patron has taken his share of the tithe,
and the bishop another share, the cur√© is likely to be
left with barely enough income to put him among the
better class of peasants.</p>

<p>Yet, after all, he is now caught up into the great body
politic of the Church. The latter will not let him starve.
It will give him a decent old age. It will protect him
against those gross cruelties which seigneurs may inflict
on any peasant. It will make him the most important
individual in the average village&mdash;often the only person
therein understanding the mysteries of parchments.
If he is a worthy man, his influence as counselor, friend,
and arbiter will be almost boundless. He will receive
a personal respect almost equal to that due to a cavalier.
Finally, there is always the chance that he may win
some magnate's favor, and by good luck or merit rise
to greater things. Father Gr√©goire, Conon's chaplain,
although nominally only a poor priest, is probably more
influential in St. Aliquis than Sire Eustace, the seneschal&mdash;Conon
sometimes complains good naturedly that
he is more powerful than Conon himself. So then, apart
from any desire for strictly religious leadership, it is no
bad thing for a lad of humble origin to be appointed
parish priest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evil and Faithful Priests</div>

<p>If, however, to receive a parish means not a holy
trust, but a sordid opportunity, what a chance for making
the fiends rejoice! Every jongleur, when he runs
out of more legitimate stories, chatters about godless
priests. Charges against the parish clergy are the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
coin of filthy gossip&mdash;how they violate their vows of
celibacy in a shameless manner; how they frequent
taverns, take part in low brawls, drink "up to their
throats," and lie torpid in the fields; how they fight
with their parishioners; how they sell strong drink like
tapsters; how they play dice, gamble and often cheat
their opponents, etc.</p>

<p>Another set of charges is that if their means admit,
they wear armor like nobles, or dress like foppish laymen,
and ride out with hawks or dogs. More familiar still
are the accusations of extreme covetousness; of the
outrageous exaction of fees for administering the sacraments,
even to the dying; of performing shameless
marriages for money; of refusing burial services until
they have been bribed; and, in short, of converting
themselves into financial harpies.</p>

<p>All this is undeniable. Yet it must be remembered
that the number of parish clergy is very great, and the
proportion of evildoers is (considering their manner
of appointment) no more than might be expected.
Many of the parish priests are true ministers of God who
counsel the simple, persuade the erring, comfort the
sorrowing, and leave the world better than they found
it. A few, too, spend their leisure in genuine pursuit of
learning, like that Father Lambert of Ardes (in Flanders)
who is deeply read in old Latin authors and Christian
fathers and who has composed an excellent local chronicle&mdash;worthy
to rank with the best produced in the
monasteries.</p>

<p>Taken, therefore, at large, despite much dross, the
men of the Church do not cast away their great opportunity.
If alms and charity relieve the wretched, if letters
and science have a genuine power, if the world retains
other ideals than those of the tourney, the feud, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
foray, if villeins are taught that they, too, are men with
immortal souls no less than are the barons, the glory
belongs surely not to the castle, but to the monastery
and to the parish. And when a good churchman dies,
especially, of course, if he has been an effective and
benignant bishop, all the region knows its loss. When
the late Bishop of Auxerre departed, it was written,
"It would be impossible to tell how great was the
mourning throughout the entire city, and with what
groaning and lamentations sorrow was shown by all who
followed his funeral." While of the great and good
Bishop Maurice of Paris, builder of Notre Dame, it
was recorded, when he passed in 1196, that "he was a
vessel of affluence, a fertile olive tree in the house of the
Lord. He shone by his knowledge, his preaching, his
many alms, and his good deeds."</p>

<p class="mb2">Like every other institution, the Church of the Feudal
Age is entitled to be judged by its best and not by its
worst.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXIV: The Cathedral and Its Builders.</h2>


<p><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_422.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="drop-cap">B</span>aron Conon and Adela had still
another duty ere they returned to St.
Aliquis. They were fain to go with
their sons, and each burn a tall candle
before the altar of Our Lady in the
cathedral. All dwellers near Pontdebois
are intensely proud of their great church. It has been
building now these forty years. At last it is fairly complete,
although the left tower has still to be carried up to
the belfry, and very many niches lack the sculptured
saints presently to occupy them. A worthy cathedral,
like a worthy character, is growing continually. Probably
the Feudal Age will end before Notre Dame de
Pontdebois is completed as its pious designers have
intended.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The cathedral is the center for a large group of buildings
whereof most are in the noble pointed (Gothic)
style of architecture. As just explained, in the sacred
close there is the bishop's palace and the houses of the
canons; there are also a cloister for promenading, a
school (much like that at the monastery), a room for a
library, and a synodal hall for meetings of the canons
and where the bishop can conduct litigation. There
is, in addition, a hospital for sick clerics. The whole
forms a little world sequestered from the uproar and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
sordid bustle of the marts and workshops of Pontdebois.
As you enter the cathedral compound, exterior cares
are suddenly left behind you&mdash;a great sense of peace is
realized. One hears the wind softly whistling through
the soaring tracery of the massive right tower. There
is a whirring flutter of doves from their homes under
the flying buttresses. Through a section opened in the
floral tracery of a great window comes the rumbling of
an organ and the deep Gregorian chant of some hymn
from the psalter. Utter contrast it all is either to the
hammering and chaffering of the city, or the equally
worldly clatter of the castle court! The vast tower
pointing upward speaks even to the thoughtless, "Fortress
and city, trade and tourney endure only for the
instant&mdash;the things of the Spirit abide forever."</p>

<p>The cathedral, by its vast and soaring bulk, completely
dwarfs the comparatively small and mean houses of the
town. They are of thatch and wood. It is of stone.
They lack even a tawdry magnificence. The cathedral
could gaze with contempt on royal palaces. This fact
teaches even more clearly than words the enormous
place occupied by the Church in the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Fuedal'">Feudal</ins> Age. It
is not by its literature and learning (though these are
not to be despised), but <em>by its sacred architecture
and sculpture</em> that the spirit of this era displays its
power and originality. In contemplating so magnificent
a fabric, it is best to remember that it is the work of men
of ardent faith, profoundly convinced that in the church
building there dwells continually upon the high altar
God himself, invisible but ever present. Squalid
dwellings may suffice for man, but not for the Creator.
And since God actually takes his abode in such an
edifice, every art must contribute to its splendor. Architects,
sculptors, painters, jewelers, all perform their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>best, each rendering his homage to the Eternal. The
cathedral, therefore, sums up all that is noblest in the
art of the time when it is erected.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="i_424"></a>
  <img src="images/i_424.jpg" width="400" height="216" alt="NOTRE DAME AND THE BISHOP'S PALACE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">NOTRE DAME AND THE BISHOP'S PALACE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY</p>
<p class="center">From the restoration of M. Hoffbauer. At the left the Petit-Pont and the buildings of the archbishop's palace, destroyed in 1831;
the cathedral, of which the choir and the south transept were finished only at this date; behind the cathedral, on the ground
occupied to-day by a public garden, was the church of Saint-Denis du Pas, built previous to the cathedral and destroyed in 1813.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>Since the nave of such a church often can be used for
secular mass meetings without fear of impiety, and
since a whole countryside will claim the right to throng
the edifice on great festival days, a cathedral has to be
far larger than an ancient pagan temple.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> It must
possess an interior meet for elaborate processions, stopping
often at each of twenty-odd altars lining its walls.
To erect a building like this is an undertaking in which
a whole countryside can be asked to join. About forty
years ago the old cathedral, built in the ancient Romanesque
(round-arched) style with a wooden roof, was
falling into disrepair, and the new pointed, stone-vaulted
architecture was developing through all France.
People from regions round made remarks about the
"impiety" of the clergy and folk near Pontdebois in
"dishonoring heaven." Various prelates taunted the
ruling Bishop Thibaut with his mean cathedral. This
Thibaut, however, had been an energetic as well as a
devout man. By prudent administration of the diocese
he had saved considerable money. He next persuaded
his canons to curtail their luxuries and to contribute
generously. Means, too, were taken to lure money
from the faithful. The holy relics were exhibited.
Indulgence from purgatory was promised to donors.
Conscience-stricken barons were urged to atone for
their crimes by liberal gifts to the new enterprise. Civic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
pride and excited piety won the deniers from the Pontdebois
trade and industrial masters. A rich countess left
a notable legacy on condition that the canons should
always pray for her soul on the anniversary of her death.
So between coaxing and religious feeling a goodly fund
was collected&mdash;and, as was wisely said, "the new cathedral
has saved many souls"&mdash;meaning that many sinful
people were happily moved to redeeming acts of
generosity. There were even gifts, it is said, from
brigands and evil women, likewise a good many less
debatable presents in kind, as when a baron gave both
the necessary oak and the pay of the carvers for making
the magnificent choir stalls, besides presenting the
great stained-glass rose window. Whatever the source,
no donation was denied, the bishop counting it fortunate
if even the booty of thieves could be turned to the
glory of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Building the Cathedral</div>

<p>Bishop Thibaut found a skillful architect, a Norman,
half cleric, half layman, who had assisted on one of the
great churches at Rouen. The plans this man drew up
were very elaborate, but he did not live to see them
more than half executed. Even if workmen and money
failed not, it was dangerous to rush the erection of the
great piers, buttresses, and vaulted ceilings. At Auxerre,
where they tried to hasten the work, much of the choir
suddenly collapsed "like a crash of thunder," though
Heaven mercifully prevented the loss of life. At Noyon
they began to build in 1152. Their cathedral was nearly
finished by 1200. Notre Dame de Paris was begun in
1163, and the choir was fairly completed by 1177; but
the great towers and fa√ßade certainly cannot be finished
before 1225. Rheims was begun in 1211, but undoubtedly
even the work on the choir cannot be ended under thirty
years from that date. If Pontdebois is reasonably complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
after forty years of effort it is therefore being
built more expeditiously than the average cathedral.
Indeed, many wiseacres shake their heads. "Too much
haste," they mutter; "when one builds for God and in
order to last till His Judgment Day, it is very sinful to
hurry."</p>

<p>First the choir was finished with all energy possible,
for here the canons must constantly chant their offices.
The nave, which was more for popular gatherings,
waited till later. There was great rejoicing when at last
the main portal was so far completed that a very fine and
tenderly carved statue of Christ could be set above the
same. "<i>Our beautiful God!</i>" the people lovingly
call the image; and from that time, year by year, the
work went forward, every member or ornament that
was added seeming to suggest something additional,
as if the achieving of perfection were to be a work for
eternity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cathedral a Natural Growth</div>

<p>To erect the main structure of his cathedral, Thibaut
had called in a traveling fraternity of workmen, the
Lodging-House Keepers of the Good God, who obeyed
the Master of the Work&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, an architect. They
would stay for years in one place, recruiting new members
as old ones died, then moving elsewhere when no longer
needed. This fraternity erected the main structure of
the building; then Thibaut passed away, money failed,
and enthusiasm somewhat lapsed. However, twenty
years later, a new fraternity were put to work on the
fa√ßade and towers. This was more delicate work,
involving a great deal of skillful carving. They were
obliged to stop again before completion had been attained.
Probably a score of years hence, still another
such fraternity will raise the second tower. Meantime,
every year, a few skillful craftsmen, sustained by donations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
add a statue here and a gargoyle yonder, put
richly painted glass into another window, or complete the
intricate carving around the railing to the pulpit stairs.
Now and then there is a special exhibition of relics to
attract worshipers and their alms.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> One of the results
is that the style of the different parts of the cathedral
differs subtly according to the respective periods of their
construction. There is not a contradiction, but only a
pleasing variety. One feels that <em>the cathedral is something
living</em>. It has come into being, not by arbitrary
creation, but by a natural growth; like a mighty, comfort-spreading
tree.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 205px;"><a id="i_429"></a>
  <img src="images/i_429.jpg" width="205" height="600" alt="THIRTEENTH-CENTURY WINDOW" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">THIRTEENTH-CENTURY WINDOW IN THE CATHEDRAL OF CHARTRES,
REPRESENTING SAINT CHRISTOPHER CARRYING CHRIST</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>As we wander about this glorious fabric, with its
hundreds of statues,<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> its blazing windows, its vaulted
roof which hangs its massive weight of stone so safely
above our heads, all attempts at detailed description
become futile. Let them be left for other books and other
moods. Later generations doubtless will record at great
length that about the middle of the twelfth century a
great activity in church building, as a surpassing work
of Christian piety, began to manifest itself especially in
northern France. This activity was not to spend itself
for more than a hundred years.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> It absorbed much of the
best thought and energy of the time. In addition, it
developed a genuinely new type of architecture, a real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
innovation upon those models
traceable back to the pagan
Greek. We come to the reign
of the pointed arch which
adapts itself to endless curves
and varieties. We have, too,
the grouped columns which
uphold the groins of the lofty
vaulting, their members
radiating outward like the
boughs of a stately forest.
These columns and piers can
be made amazingly light,
thanks to the daring use of
flying buttresses, an invention
not merely of great
utility, but of great beauty.
Thanks also to these grouped
pillars, groins, and buttresses,
the walls between the bays
(intervals between the columns)
are in no wise needed
to uphold the roof of stone;
and as a result these bays
can be filled up with thin
curtain walls crowned above
with enormous windows
which are filled with a delicate
tracery and a stained
glass that throws down upon
the pavement of the church all
the rainbow tints of heaven.
Each bay is likely to contain a separate chapel or at least
an altar to some particular saint. Over the portal, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
the main entrance gives access to the long nave, radiates
the mighty rose window, the final triumph of the glass
and tracery. And so through all the vast structure&mdash;huge
in proportions, yet, as it were, a harmonious mass
of fair carving and jewel work, until (even as says
Holy Writ) "the whole body fitly joined together, and
compacted by that which every joint supplyeth, according
to the effectual working in every part, maketh
increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in
love."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magnificent Dimensions of Cathedrals</div>

<p>So the apostle of the making of a Christian man, so,
too, of the making of the august church. And after
saying this, what profit to add that this cathedral has a
length of about four hundred feet, that the ceiling
of the nave rises at least one hundred feet above the
pavement, that the rose window is nearly forty feet in
diameter, that the higher tower is much more than two
hundred?<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Numbers are for sordid traffic, they are not
for a work wrought out of a passionate love of man
toward God.</p>

<p>We cannot stay to linger over the symbolism which
they tell us is in every part of the church; how the
"Communion of Saints" is proclaimed by the chapels
clustering around the choir and nave; how the delicate
spire which rises at the center of the transepts teaches
that "vanquishing earthly desire we should also ascend
in heart and mind"; how the triple breadth of the nave
and two aisles, likewise the triple stretch of the choir,
transepts and nave, proclaim the Holy Trinity; and
how the serried armies of piers and columns announce
the Prophets and Apostles who uphold the fabric of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>Church; while font, altar, crucifix, and crosses innumerable
attest the earthly pilgrimage and redeeming passion
of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>But the cathedral is more than a great collection of
allegories. Everywhere in stained glass, and still more
in the multitudinous images, is told the Bible story.
The characters are not clothed in Hebraic fashion.
"Baron Abraham" and "Sire David" appear in ring
mail like doughty cavaliers. The history of the good
warrior Judas Maccab√¶us perhaps is told in greater
detail than that of prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah.
But very few important stories are omitted, and, above
all, the great pageant of the life of Jesus is worked out
in loving detail. The child, who is brought time and
again to visit the cathedral, knows almost every essential
Bible narrative, albeit he may never learn to read even
French, much less to con the Latin of the Vulgate.
Likewise, in the cathedral rest the tombs of brave seigneurs
and worthy bishops, each covered either with an
effigy showing his armor and his beloved hunting dogs
couched at his feet, or in his pontificals; and the tombs
also of noble women, sculptured as richly clad, who have
made life beautiful by their worthy living, and who now
rest securely until God's great Judgment. So the cathedral
is both a temple for the hopes of the present, and
an inspiration from the remote and nearer past.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Stained Glass and Sculptures</div>

<p>After he had prayed beside his father and mother,
little Anseau stole away from the altar and wandered
timidly about the church. In a corner of a transept
he found a stone craftsman completing a small image
of St. Elizabeth to adorn some niche. The sculptor
was polishing the back of the statue no less carefully
than the front. "Why such trouble?" asked the boy
curiously. "No one can see the back." "Ah, my fair
damoiseau," replied the other, smiling, "no man, of
course; <em>but God can see</em>. This is for the Cathedral;
and is God 'no one'?"</p>

<p>The next day, having spent all their money and
become wearied of the mechanic bustle of Pontdebois,
Baron Conon and his company rode back to St. Aliquis.
After they had traveled for miles, the great mass of the
cathedral was still visible behind them.</p>

<p>The Feudal Age has produced very much that is
evil&mdash;it has also produced the Gothic church and its
builders. By which ought the epoch be judged?</p>

<p class="mt2 mb2">Seven hundred years afterward the donjon of St.
Aliquis is an ivy-covered ruin. Vanished is the monastery;
vanished, too, the peasants' huts. In the smoky
industrial city on the site of Pontdebois not one ancient
stone seems left upon another. But, hold! Soaring high
above ugly roof and factory chimney, with its airy
pinnacles denouncing a life of materialism and doubt,
visited by admiring pilgrims from beyond the Sea of
Darkness, the great fabric of the gray cathedral remains.</p>

<span class="smcap">By Elie Faure</span></p>

<p class="center">Volume I&mdash;<i>Ancient Art</i><br />
<i>Translated from the French by Walter Pach</i></p>

<p>No History of Art fills the place of this one. It
shows art to be the expression of the race, not an
individual expression of the artist. It tells <em>why</em> and
<em>how</em> man constructs works of art. <em>Nearly 200 unusual
and beautiful illustrations selected by the author.</em></p>


<p class="center">
DEVELOPMENT OF EMBROIDERY IN AMERICA<br />
<span class="smcap">By Candace Wheeler</span></p>

<p>A history of embroidery from the quill and beadwork
of the American Indians to the artistic achievement
of the present. A book to delight the collector
and to serve as a guide for the art student, designer,
and practical worker. <em>32 pages of illustrations&mdash;some
in full color.</em></p>


<p class="center">HOW FRANCE BUILT HER CATHEDRALS<br />
<span class="smcap">By Elizabeth Boyle O'Reilly</span></p>

<p>The Boston <cite>Herald</cite> writes: "It is a monumental work,
of living interest alike to the erudite devotee of the
arts and to the person who simply enjoys, in books or
his travels, the wonderful and beautiful things that have
come from the hand of man ... the story of the French
cathedrals against a human background&mdash;of the great
men and women of the time." <em>With 31 illustrations in
tint.</em></p>


<p class="center">PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATION<br />
<span class="smcap">By John D. Whiting</span></p>

<p>For artists who wish to sell their work, for publishers
and advertisers who buy it, and for those
responsible for mechanical reproduction. It will give
the artist a full knowledge of trade requirements. It
will teach the art buyer what to look for and provide
against in originals. It will help the photo-engraver
and photographer to eliminate defects in mechanical
reproduction. <em>The author illustrates his points in 25
page plates, many in full color.</em></p>
